            "rendered": "\n<p>I recently discovered I was born under the malevolent star Algorab. Like most stars observable without high-powered telescopes, its name is ancient, derived from the Arabic meaning \u201cthe crow\u201d. This is in reference to its dark glimmer and the gifts of craftiness and subterfuge it is said to lend those born under it. Discovering that my ruling planet occupies a place of mendacity was data I initially found disconcerting, not quite confirming what I know about myself but not totally untrue either. It settled into my mind like sand through water, at first cloudy; but then\u2014another layer. It makes sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery was one of many peppering my return to astrology as a sort of lockdown time-suck, following an impulse to find out exactly, mystically, what was wrong with me. As I entered the popularly notorious transit of another dark star, the period around 27-30 called the Saturn return, I wanted to take the reins from the horoscopes of Susan Miller and others that I had previously relied upon for sometimes misfiring insight. I read horoscopic reports for years as a way of gaining self-knowledge and something like agency. It is easy for me to register a selfish impulse in their appeal, a sort of cosmic narcissism confirming fate&#8217;s vicissitudes as they relate to me. But there is also something else, some hungry locution that tessellates like poetry about the depths of what is \u2014 in general, not just for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the same pull I recognise operating on peers in the weird resurgence of astrology over the last few years. It appears to have surpassed the just-for-fun framing that seemed to characterise it when I was growing up in the 90s and early 00s, ascending to epistemological seriousness in the wake of new waves of spirituality and the internet&#8217;s removal of access barriers to formerly esoteric or marginal fields of thought. Astrology is increasingly treated as a vital stream of data among many others, intersecting with trend forecasts, political analyses, family planning and crypto investment with equal gusto. It has expanded, amoeba-like, to conquer both the cosmic left and the cosmic right; the most cynical zoomer insight memes as well as toxically wounded yummy mummy wellness discourse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If finding the capacity to process unprecedented information flows is now a necessity, astrology can be seen as archetypal of the data-for-the-sake-of-data repost culture that grips our current moment. As Emily Segal argues, this can be further refined to the astrological phenomenon of Mercury retrograde, when the planet of communications appears to move backwards in the sky, heralding travel delays, technological failures and bungled messages as it does so. Writing during the first flush of the current wave of astrological popularity in 2016, Segal takes the already-pass\u00e9 fear of Mercury\u2019s backward motion as a paradigm: not just as the most accessible belief-meme of the way astrology operates in the world, but also as an apt description of the global information economy it circulates within, one that is in constant, crisis-laden glitch.<cite>Emily Segal, 2015, &#8216;Mercury Retrograde,&#8217; e\u2013flux journal 65, accessed August 28, 2015, from http:\/\/supercommunity.e-flux.com\/texts\/mercury-retrograde\/<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s no longer news that astrology has gone mainstream, it\u2019s still true there is a distinction between the way that it popularly circulates amongst lay people and its actual implications as a system of poetic insight. Shifting from Co\u2013star notifications as a primary source material to serious astrological texts dealing with whole charts and calculation techniques is also just a shift in the sorts of filters and rubrics that need to be applied to receive and interpret its multidirectional information. It&#8217;s all just processing, which can seem baffling to sceptics and outsiders who assume that almost all astrology is cold-read from the stereotypical ether. For these people, the marketing of astrology is the thing that is foregrounded, leading to the belief that astrology is nothing but marketing, content concomitant with its context. For those a little further in, we realise that there is an independent mechanism at work, but what is it, if not another proliferation of desire and data?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Divination<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there is confusion and debate surrounding this point, astrology is, fundamentally just another form of divination: like tarot, like tea leaves. This may be surprising for those who assume its causality to be rooted in some vaguely defined planetary \u201cinfluence\u201d, in the same way that the Sun controls the seasons and the Moon the tides (and did you know that our bodies are 70% water?) There are even practicing astrologers who reason in this way. Such a logic seems intuitive, supposing that astrology works because celestial bodies, even those further out with minute earthly visibility and gravitational pull, emit energies that affect how we feel and act in this world. But it is a historically contingent logic. As Geoffrey Cornelius points out, the \u201cwhy\u201d of astrology has strategically shifted from its uncomfortable beginnings in ancient religion and into whatever is the prevailing science of the day.<cite>Geoffrey Cornelius, 2000, \u2018Is Astrology Divination \u2014 and Does it Matter?\u2019 CURA, accessed January 2, 2022, from http:\/\/cura.free.fr\/quinq\/01gfcor.html. The diagram is lifted from its first publication in &#8216;The Mountain Astrologer&#8217;, via Cosmocritic&#8217;s publication: http:\/\/www.cosmocritic.com\/pdfs\/Cornelius_Geoffrey_Is_Astrology_Divination.pdf  <\/cite> Natural philosophy was followed by humoral theory, gravity, magnetism, radio waves, depth psychology, and most recently quantum physics. These are scientific frameworks that provide a pretence of rationalism to cloak the actually quite irrational operation of divining from the planets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that such reasoning prevails, both amongst lay people and actual practicing astrologers, can be contextualised within the various historical hegemonies of Greek philosophy, Christian monotheism and post-Enlightenment rationalism that the tradition has survived within. Its post-Copernican relegation to one of the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.journals.uchicago.edu\/doi\/10.1086\/349279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wretched subjects<\/a>\u201d is rooted in an epistemological climate that institutionally rejected divination as unscientific because unprovable. Astrology still elicits a strong emotional reaction among contemporary academics, scientists and sceptics.<cite>\u201cStrong emotional reaction\u201d is from Helena Avelar, see Luis Ribeiro and Chris Brennan detailing her life and work on \u2018The Astrology Podcast,\u2019 ep. 324.<\/cite> It is no wonder then, that science continues to be the decisive language of its justification, just as individualism has become its most common inflection. The strategy has sometimes been enough to save astrology from being cast as straight-up fortune telling and targeted in historical legislation and purges, but has also left the discipline open to basic astronomical critiques that regularly surface \u2014 for example, professing new or alternative sun signs due to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.astrologyzone.com\/the-nasa-controversy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">precession of the equinoxes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2022\/01\/24022121\/Picture-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2322\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Astrology&#8217;s obfuscation as divination is helped by the maths and empiricism at the system&#8217;s core, which seem to differentiate it from other forms of plumbing the depths. The mathematical component of astrology also means that the system&#8217;s abstraction into scientific language has been more than just strategic: it is also an extension of the foundational abstraction that makes a \u201cbirth chart\u201d possible. As a systematised calculation of observance, where each of the planets and stars have been assigned meanings and mechanised via their perceived positions relative to the Earth, the chart is partially removed from the divinatory premise that sees, for example, a creepy blood moon eclipse and surmises the impending death of the king. It feigns objectivity through complicated math that makes it seem more than the subjective interpretation of visceral experiences in nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the spiritual element of astrology is remembered in elements such as names of the planets, taken from the classical Greek gods because they were originally thought to be their direct emissaries.<cite>Ancient astrology was first developed in ancient Babylon and Egypt, meaning the stars (aka planets) were originally assigned names of deities belonging to those cultures, with significations that were imported and combined with Greek counterparts. Venus was Innana in ancient Babylon, with a myth detailing her journey through the \u201cunderworld\u201d as she is doing in retrograde as I am writing this: going behind the sun to change from an evening to morning star and losing her garments as she does so.<\/cite> Divine omens indicating events on earth have always come in the form of natural phenomenon \u2014 an eagle with a swallow in its mouth, for example<cite>The omen at the end of Homer&#8217;s &#8216;Odyssey&#8217;.<\/cite> \u2014 and using the movement of the planets and mapping parts of the sky is a way of sealing these omens within a symbolic system that ensures a constant and collectively-observable stream of omen-based symbolism. This \u201cMachine of Destiny\u201d, as Cornelius terms it, is reflected in the functions of the earliest computers such as the Antikythera mechanism and astrolabes, which are principally tied to systemic sky observance. Other forms of divination, like the 78 traditional tarot cards, the I Ching, or <a href=\"https:\/\/para.wiki\/w\/Wikimancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wikimancy<\/a>, rely on similar forms of abstraction via human-made texts and visual systems. But none is so effective as to be able to integrate mechanised time and actual natural occurrences into a chartable, navigable and almost-infinite clock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Psychology<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The robustness of the astrological system is of course core to its appeal, both now and in the past; it is a clock that spins backwards past capitalism and on through environmental Armageddon. Astrology&#8217;s ability to speak to personal experiences as well as political realities have cemented its ineffable and incorrigible continuity as a cultural force across civilisations. In late capitalism it occupies a space that Theodor Adorno called a sort of \u201cpsychological twilight\u201d, the gap between modern, rational subjectivity and premodern superstition.<cite>Theodor W. Adorno, 1957, \u2018The Stars Down to Earth: The Los Angeles Times Astrology Column: A Study in Secondary Superstition,\u2019 Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Amerikastudien 2, p. 25.<\/cite> With the dogma of rationality only strengthening through the last century, most of the effects and perceived benefits of astrology have naturally found host in psychology and therapy, fields that bring science and individualism so consummately together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is in large part due to the influence of one of astrology&#8217;s last great defenders able to parse the demands of the discipline with the demands of the academy: Carl Jung. In the decades following his death, Jung&#8217;s work has proliferated not only within institutionally sanctioned psychoanalysis and cultural studies, but also in astrological practice.<cite>Most notably through the work of astrologers Dane Rudhyar, Steven Arroyo and Liz Greene.<\/cite> Contemporary Jungian analysts sometimes frame astrology as valuable in its \u201ccompensatory\u201d function, an irrational respite from the exactitudes of ordering one&#8217;s life and emotional world according to the mores of rational modern subjectivity. Meanwhile the Jungian approach to astrology emphasises astrological archetypes as forming part of the \u201ccollective unconscious\u201d, moving through the chart as they move through myth to influence our experiences and understanding of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a way, psychological astrology tacitly accepts the divinatory premise of the system as a symbolic language in excess of reason, but it also often restricts astrology from making predictions or even descriptions of concrete events. In this kind of astrology, Mars in the fourth house is more likely to signify masculinity issues than it is to herald a house fire. The irony is that this is a narrower application than Jung himself adhered to. He understood astrology as a form of synchronicity: an acausal, meaningful connection that is simultaneously \u201cnuminous\u201d, meaning it contains an element of the divine. The definition sidesteps science in eschewing \u201cprovability\u201d as a validating rubric, walking the fine line of claims that are rationally permissible to espouse in its reference to the spiritual. Synchronicity can approach the twilight of the rational mind as Freud did, through dreams, but Jung&#8217;s model provides a framework that also allows for access to an unconscious that is more broadly defined, bridging the individual with the shared physical universe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most famous instance of synchronicity Jung records doesn&#8217;t focus on astrology at all, but an earthly omen. He recounts one of his clients, a young, educated woman, telling him about her dream the night before, where she was gifted a golden scarab beetle. He hears a tapping at the window of his dark office on the shores of Lake Zurich, opens the window, and to both of their surprise a golden beetle, \u201cthe nearest analogy to a scarab one finds in our latitudes,\u201d flies in.<cite>Carl G. Jung, 1973, <em>Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle<\/em>, Trans. R. F. C. Hull, Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 31.<\/cite> The episode is meaningful because the woman had been struggling to find a way of dealing with her emotions in a way that squared with her institutional education. The physically manifest sign, in its glinting gold and natural splendour, is permissive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Wellness<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The connection between the literal interpretation of signs and their psychological significance is what makes astrology so enticing as a response to crisis, both personal and political. Framed this way, the current resurgence of astrology has taken place within the glitchy geopolitical spiral that has seemed to characterise the last few years, not least \u2014 in astrological terms \u2014 Saturn&#8217;s movement into the social, societal air sign of Aquarius in March 2020 and the widespread transmission of this socially-restrictive respiratory virus. Along with magic, which has also undergone a resurgence, the revival of astrology has been fomented by crises and precarity that form a fertile breeding ground for alternative belief, demanding personal agency and insight where their lack has most often been foregrounded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current popularity of astrologers that unify political concerns with individual wellness is characteristic of this dynamic. Among them is humanistic astrologer-cum-counsellor Jessica Lanyadoo, who started her now-cultish podcast in 2018 explicitly because she was concerned about the disastrous alignments of 2020. Lanyadoo coaches her listeners on traditional astrological topics like love and money in a way that is compelling but also deeply tenderqueer and fragility baiting, tapping into the \u201cqueer witch\u201d phenomenon in a way that is broadly accessible. She also dwells on ways to optimise responses to social upheavals and contributions to justice movements while maintaining personal integrity and warding off burnout. I listened for a while when I was depressed in the middle of the first round of lockdowns, until I realised that almost every transit she described seemed to signify a harshly intense collective mental health episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gets at the danger inherent to the divinatory principle: that it is interpretive. Multidirectional assonance can slip quickly into vagaries, and people (astrologers included) can say literally whatever they want. If the current astrology boom is located partly in the demands placed upon us in late capitalism, astrology is enticing because, as Tabitha Prado Richardson posits, it is expansive enough \u201cto carry both optimism and pessimism depending on emotional necessity.\u201d<cite>Tabitha Prado Richardson, 2019, \u2018Who Needs Astrology?\u2019 in The Lifted Brow, accessed January 2, 2022, from https:\/\/www.theliftedbrow.com\/liftedbrow\/2019\/11\/10\/who-needs-astrology-by-tabitha-prado-richardson.<\/cite> Even after deciding I would stop listening to the pod while scheming, doing admin, or supplementing social contact, after I had started to learn astrology and discovered some of the alarmist sentiment was pretty unfounded \u2014 I found myself returning to listen out of the sheer comfort of vaguely \u201cknowing what was up\u201d. The data was flowing. This brings us back to Adorno&#8217;s analysis, that astrology doesn&#8217;t need total adherence in order to do its compelling work. For most consumers, it simply suffices to \u201cget the dope\u201d.<cite>Adorno, p. 22.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Dope<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adorno&#8217;s rancorous piece aligns astrology with his view of Hollywood and other forms of media selling a dream: as nothing more than a series of psychological hooks exploiting contemporary experiences of alienation. The object of his study, Carroll Righter&#8217;s <em>LA Times<\/em> horoscopic column, can have no factual basis and so merely takes advantage of feelings of powerlessness among those who are structurally excluded, or simply not intelligent enough to grasp the way that power actually moves in the world. This not only connects astrology, presciently, with witchcraft \u2014 a last resort of women, queer people, poor people and ethnic minorities \u2014 but also with a sort of flatearther or QAnon-style \u201ctruth reveal\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conspiracy theories are the domain of the unintelligent because they replicate the heady gestures of exposure that have characterised modern intellectualism, what Paul Ricoeur called \u201cthe Masters of Suspicion\u201d and Eve Sedgwick \u201cparanoid epistemologies\u201d.<cite>See Sedgwick\u2019s essay \u2018Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You\u2019re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You,\u2019 (1996) and Ricoeur\u2019s <em>Freud and Philosophy<\/em> (1965).<\/cite> Adorno\u2019s phrase, \u201cprophets of deceit\u201d, speaks more to the way in which insight itself is commodified and circulated in popular media.<cite>Adorno, p. 81.<\/cite> Another term might be outrage. Denouncing the puppet masters, be they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newshub.co.nz\/home\/lifestyle\/2020\/12\/nz-lingerie-lonely-co-owner-accused-of-sharing-qanon-conspiracy-theories-creating-uncomfortable-work-environment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transsexual cabalists<\/a> or out of sect malefics, always seems more intelligent than it actually is, because it gives the illusion of interpretive agency and special insight while flatly dramatising the loss of control to mechanisms larger than the adherent. This is why Adorno identifies astrology with the still-present threat of fascism, because, on the face of things, they share some of the same psychological motivations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a sinister lens indeed for viewing the recent rise in astrology\u2019s popularity, forming an irrational, woke-seeming mirror to the fascist movements that are also in resurgence globally.<cite>While I was writing this my favourite podcast host Chris Brennan of <em>The Astrology Podcast<\/em> even mentioned the fear of this elision as a potential source of backlash against the recent rise in astrology&#8217;s popularity. See ep. 331 with Adam Sommer.<\/cite> Adorno warns that in its dramatisation of systems of control, insinuations of fear and emphasis on optimisation, astrology ultimately marks the \u201ctransition of an educated liberal ideology to a totalitarian one.\u201d<cite>Adorno pp. 22 &amp; 87.<\/cite> Like fascism, it proliferates messages from on high covering every conceivable topic of life, advising how best to self-regulate and succeed under current circumstances, while regimenting all pleasure into either cosmically-permitted ecstasy or endless readjustments of labour. Most sinister of all, astrology justifies itself not only as a science, but also as a return to the past and ancient systems centuries in refinement, just as fascists advocate a reprise of eugenics and a fictional racially homogenous past. If we follow Adorno&#8217;s line, this is all trickling into our consciousness every time we read that menacing little paragraph next to the stylised glyph belonging to our sun sign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Power<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that the current astrological renaissance has been spearheaded in large part by women who are young, queer and of colour, and its nearest legacy is most stereotypically espoused by older hippies, perhaps obscures its lineage as a system transmitted via the pens of mostly ruling-class-adjacent men.<cite>Chani Nicholas is to my knowledge the first mega-popular astrologer to bring a millennial leftist lens to the practice. Demetra George&#8217;s work is significant in delineating meanings for the asteroid goddesses in the 1970s, interpreting their discovery as attendant to the recuperation of the feminine in patriarchal culture.<\/cite> The Reagans, the Nazis and J.P. Morgan all turned to astrology, just as ancient rulers used it to plan warfare, power grabs and acts of violence. Its image as a trapping of the young left is only recent, and perhaps has more to do with the terrain of the culture wars in which we currently find ourselves. The crisis of liberal ideology that became most apparent through the 2010s can be contrasted with a new form of liberalism that, in a certain sense, has already begun integrating astrology into its worldview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDisguised\u201d forms of astrology have circulated for years, perhaps most significantly in the (now waning) popularity of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stellarmaze.com\/myers-briggs-is-astrology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator<\/a>. The personality test was based on Jung&#8217;s <em>Psychological Types <\/em>(1923), in which he used the elements of astrology, the triplicities, to describe his patients. Katherine Briggs and Isabel Myers used this to formulate an independent system of archetypal assonance that has found use in everything from dating apps to corporate human resources. Today it&#8217;s like these soft takes, or even people being cagey about their astrological adherence in casual conversation, have been dispensed with. Some companies now openly filter candidates based on star sign to balance office dynamics, just as some tweaked sharehouses do, in what has been dubbed in certain outrage pieces (and a strikingly ironic turn of the astro data industry) \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90398481\/from-tarot-readings-to-gemini-memes-astrology-has-officially-infiltrated-work-culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">astrological discrimination<\/a>\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sun signs obviously do not have the same structural consequences as other kinds of identity, and yet, as a form of categorisation that depends on a certain level of collectively-upheld magical thinking, astrology can be productively compared to race.<cite>Alice Sparkly Kat, 2021, \u2018Introduction to Postcolonial Astrology,\u2019 accessed January 2, 2022, from https:\/\/www.alicesparklykat.com\/articles\/192\/Introduction_to_Postcolonial_Astrology\/<\/cite> Ancient delineations for planetary configurations, like their twentieth-century counterparts, create and maintain value distinctions that favour strong men and lightness, resource extraction and productivity, often denigrating foreigners, angry women, drug use and sexual nonconformity. Because of the influence of archaic male-authored sources (Ptolemy, for example), interpretive precedents often look back to an idealised Greco-Roman past in which the man was a self-governing entity, keeping his slaves in the 6th house of his chart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The astrologer Alice Sparkly Kat and author of <em>Postcolonial Astrology <\/em>(2021) says that, due to the nature of its lineage, astrology is like whiteness in that \u201cit makes itself visible when certain sociopolitical relations are under threat\u201d.<cite>ibid.<\/cite> Evil historical figures used astrological insights to supplement fantasies of maintaining power, or to justify their claims to divinely ordained supremacy. The Roman emperor Augustus published his apparently auspicious birth chart as propaganda to bolster his reign, and Goebbels hired astrologers to fabricate predictions of the \u201cThousand Year Reich\u201d, after scouring Nostradamus for the same reasons.<cite>MI6 also hired an astrologer during WWII on hearing the Nazis were dabbling in a perverse sort of divinatory arms race. See Eric Kurlander, 2020, \u2018Obsessed with the Occult: Adolf Hitler and his Nazi regime turned to voodoo science in their drive for supremacy,\u2019 HistoryNet, accessed January 2, 2022, from https:\/\/www.historynet.com\/obsessed-with-the-occult.htm <\/cite> Whether these figures and the regimes they represented actually put faith in astrology is irrelevant (both carried out purges and execrations on astrologers and fortune tellers) \u2014 they recognised its power in commanding an iconic sort of legitimacy through the production of persuasive media content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Advertising<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Segal&#8217;s work on Mercury retrograde began with a previous project called K-hole, a trend-forecasting collective that published a series of trend reports as art texts engaging the commercial form. The 2015 <em>Report on Doubt <\/em>articulates magic as an \u201corganising principle already in operation in our world.\u201d It is a read on astrology: \u201cWe&#8217;re talking about magic, not wizardry. People believe they are Slytherin; they don&#8217;t believe they can fly on brooms.\u201d The point seems to be that identity formation through commercialised categories, like those offered by sun signs, are a primary vector for contemporary experiences of the numinous. Belief runs quickly into purchases stamped with preternatural significance through the easy branding of typologies that offer the depth of characterisation to people, places, moments and things. The commercial use of astrology is evident around us, in designers offering twelve different star sign necklaces or bags, or the division of personality types into Sailor Moon characters, each with her particular lip gloss shade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was reminded of this effectiveness a few months ago when the Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.gov.au\/ministers\/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp\/media\/minister-hunts-press-conference-in-canberra-on-20-october-2021-on-the-vaccination-rollout-vaccine-booster-update-stem-cell-mission-grants-booster-program-and-net-zero-emissions-policy\">announced<\/a> that 70 percent of the population had been fully vaccinated. He went on to specify the figure more precisely: 70.007 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a memorable number,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s memorable above all else because it represents the movement at a national level to phase B of our national roadmap\u201d. While regular exposure may have us accustomed to barky jargon issued from the mouths of Canberra&#8217;s ad men trying to convince us they&#8217;re morally coherent and on top of the pandemic response (they&#8217;re not), the open recognition of the lucky-seeming potency of the symmetrical number was striking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The connection between astrology and advertising can also be located in the system itself, which is cultish, inexhaustible, containing a strong desirous pull evinced in astro <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iJaadee\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@marenaltman\">Tiktok<\/a> accounts with millions of followers. For K-hole, magic and branding are both concerned with inception, like divining from the time and place of birth. \u201cBut where branding is about implanting ideas in the brains of an audience, [magic] is about implanting ideas into your own.\u201d<cite>K-hole #5 A Report on Doubt. http:\/\/khole.net\/issues\/05\/<\/cite> In the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.proquest.com\/docview\/1832679127\">prosuming<\/a>\u201d economy this line is pretty blurry, a fact that is a precautious bit of salt for those reading this thinking I&#8217;m saying that advertising is \u201cbad\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While advertising is often deployed by corporate or governmental entities that do not serve us, there is agency in this kind of inceptional magic: it can be used on others or on yourself, and it is often used collectively. This is what makes astrology so powerful as a vehicle for not just information, but also for affect, a kind of epistemological labour. It is a tool for manifestation, a \u201cscience that doesn&#8217;t split subjectivity and objecthood\u201d, for better and for worse.<cite>The Jeane Dixon Effect and Hannah Black, 2015, \u2018Love Homoscopes,\u2019 The New Enquiry, January 15, 2015. Accessed January 2, 2022, from https:\/\/thenewinquiry.com\/love-homoscopes\/ <\/cite> But, as the byline of K-hole&#8217;s trend report points out, \u201cseeing the future \u2260 changing the future.\u201d Accessing agency against structures of power that attempt to monopolise various forms of magic and mysticism remains a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2022\/01\/24022233\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-16-at-6.35.51-pm.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2323\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\nFrom K-hole #5 \u201cA Report on Doubt&#8221;\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Novel<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The reparative element I see in astrology even while knowing so much of the wellness and mystical industries are toxic comes back to a faith in the power of narrative. For years before I was able to read birth charts, I read tarot from decks that also contained within them legacies of violence, puritanical Christian values, colonialism and gender hierarchies \u2014 and got a lot of personal growth out of this that didn&#8217;t necessitate thousands being spent on therapy (which I couldn&#8217;t afford at the time anyway). I also read novels, which were tools for gaining self-knowledge before anything else. Segal&#8217;s development of her original <em>e\u2013flux<\/em> piece into a novel, also titled <em>Mercury Retrograde <\/em>(2020), thus felt something like the closing of a circuit when I got a copy. It test the limits of divinatory agency and \u201creading the world\u201d in a way that is both depressing and deeply gratifying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Segal&#8217;s novel pits the efficacy of omen-interpretation against the context in which the protagonist Emily lives and works, pre-pandemic New York City and a toxic tech-bro startup with views to being tastefully radical. It uses divination as a sort of horizon of understanding that structures both the plot and Emily&#8217;s decision-making. She chooses to sell out of the art world proper and into the start-up following a session with an aura reader called Riva, reasoning that the move will be an artistic gesture towards creating new manifestations in the world transcendent of corporate efficacy. \u201cI believed it was possible to do [this] by design: creating logos, T-shirts, parties and schematics that overflowed with personal richness, disguised as mere brand differentiation\u201d.<cite>Emily Segal, 2020, <em>Mercury Retrograde<\/em>, New York: Deluge Books, p. 74.<\/cite> But rather than taking control of the data she is enlisted to create and market, Emily seems to drown in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like astrology, the company&#8217;s purpose is in layering new information over existing information, creating a stratum of meta-language that covers every conceivable topic, \u201ca map as big, or bigger than, the territory\u201d it claims to represent.<cite>Segal 2020, p. 84-85.<\/cite> It doesn&#8217;t directly turn a profit, but secures exorbitant amounts of venture capital that is used to produce networks of data and disseminate the brand in campaigns that enhance the company profile and that of its founders. \u201cLife itself is meta,\u201d one of the boys repeats, as the vehicle they have created for their own success propels them into new personal wealth (\u201crichness\u201d) that Emily only has subjunctive access to. Things obviously turn sour, despite her attempts to discover direction and take control via the signs around her: dreams, cards, articles, artworks, sweatshirts, significant asides and bodily phenomenon. The novel is a roll call of divinatory principals, signs that are correctly interpreted or not: \u201cthe whole tarot of life, laid out and ready to be read \u2014 but you don&#8217;t read it\u201d.<cite>Segal 2020, p. 63.<\/cite> The institutional force represented by the male founders and their company is impenetrable, and they end up beating Emily at her own game, creating an artwork incorporating the sigil-esque company logo that technically \u201ccost hundreds of millions of dollars to make\u201d, inclusive of Emily&#8217;s salary.<cite>Segal 2020, p. 177.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her response is to resign and implicitly tap out of the interpretive logic that was feeding her attempts at finding agency. The novel&#8217;s typological and symbolic vision sort of dissolves towards the end to see the founders as flat social actors, just people mechanistically doing what people do. The boys&#8217; faces seem to erode for Emily, in personal pain and inexplicable featurelessness, rupturing the &#8220;pareidolia&#8221; the novel dwells upon in a chapter on face-like logos: the human tendency to recognise schematic patterns in otherwise meaningless stimuli like rock faces and automobiles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Fish<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Segal\u2019s divinatory pessimism is relatable to the times that many astrology practitioners will have experienced: when interpretation goes wrong, or when it reaches the limit of what it can give. The novel reminded me of another novel subliminally structured by divinatory principals, W. G. Sebald&#8217;s <em>The Rings of Saturn<\/em>. It begins,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In August 1992, when the dog days were drawing to an end, I set off to walk the county of Suffolk, in the hope of dispelling some of the emptiness that takes hold of me whenever I have completed a long stint of work. And in fact my hope was realised, up to a point; for I have seldom felt so carefree as I did then [&#8230;] I wonder now, however, whether there might be something in the old superstition that certain ailments of the spirit and of the body are particularly likely to beset us under the sign of the Dog Star.<\/p><cite>Winfried G. Sebald, 2002, <em>The Rings of Saturn<\/em>, 1995 trans. Michael Hulse, London: Vintage, p. 1.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Sebald&#8217;s narrator collapses on the first day of his walk, partly overwhelmed by the deep, historical traces of destruction he finds littering the countryside, and partly by a vision of himself like Gregor Samsa, transformed into a cockroach crawling on the face of the earth. The information is too much, and the stars too harsh, it seems, for him to continue \u2014 and yet he does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The narrator&#8217;s walk resumes and the remainder of the book details a disarming string of (acausal, meaningful, numinous) connections related to the ongoing traces of physical and environmental ruin, wasted lives and love lost he finds in the landscape. The deluge of details spanning, for example, the rise and fall of Empress Dowager Tz&#8217;u-hsi (Cixi), drowned US fighter pilots and the former name for Sirius, the Dog Star, in Osiris, is sometimes dizzying, broken only by images and brief mentions of the journey&#8217;s practicalities. One chapter typifies of the effect of the novel itself, detailing the North Sea herring population where \u201cuntold millions [&#8230;] rise from the lightless depths\u201d and fill the shallows of the Suffolk coast in sometimes unwanted, suffocating layers. It seems a fitting metaphor for divination, literally plumbing the depths to release a potential glut of information that tends to rot in times of plenitude and in times of dearth starve out those who rely on it. The dead fish glow in the dark, while in bumper years their scales shimmer on the surface of the water, \u201cresembling ashes or snow\u201d.<cite>Sebald 2002, p. 55-56.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHello from below\u201d is a recognised shorthand for divination that draws on the symbolism of a fish rising from the deep as a sign from nature.<cite>See T. Susan Chang and Mel Meleen, \u2018Fortune&#8217;s Wheelhouse,\u2019 ep 49: The Page or Princess of Cups, July 2018. As a maritime symbol, the fish is fitting with the astrological reasoning for its own current popularity: Neptune in Pisces, the planet of illusion and delusion, of inspiration and divination, in a sign of watery expansion. See Austin Coppock in The Astrology Podcast, ep. 329.<\/cite> Catching a fish is about possession, taking what is not necessarily given, and not necessarily wished for. As a metaphor it also draws attention to a certain filtration mechanism that attempts to separate certain stimuli out as meaningful while relegating other details to obscurity; the fickleness of what you catch and when is dependent on both the tools at hand and the unseen actions of fate. The divinatory moment is fundamentally about the characterisation of time through the specificity of what information surfaces, when and how it does so. Sebald&#8217;s herring chapter also details the deformities and morbidities in the herring due to industrial pollution now seeping into the Dogger Bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Rings of Saturn <\/em>and<em> Mercury Retrograde<\/em> are alike in that they dramatise the ability of divination to shape narrative as well as the ability of narrative to shape divination. They both highlight a problem inherent to the circulation of astrology in the contemporary landscape: that its attempts to characterise identity, things and time itself, are participatory with the deep contestation of these things as they are collectively redefined in ongoing violence and crisis. This, I think, is the other driving factor in astrology&#8217;s current popularity \u2014 that like other forms of divination, it is a form of epistemological labour that has a thrilling but perilous tendency to backfire on those who seek to substantiate it too concretely. Astrology outsources forms of intuition that might otherwise be experienced in the specificity and limiting circumstances of the body into an external and abstracted framework that taps this same potential. It may not be a science but, like advertising and fishing (and tarot and tea leaves), it is a form of technology.<\/p>\n",

It\u2019s the end of the sexual revolution. Los Angeles, 1972. \u201cShe has a loving husband named Rick\u2026 a great job\u2026 a beautiful home\u2026 and everything any woman could possibly hope for. So what is Barbi Smith missing?! Could it be adventure? Could it be glamour?\u201d A pounding drum circle starts up in the background. \u201cOr could it be raw, animal SEX?\u201d Sort of. The film follows Barbi on a quest to \u201cexplore her sexuality\u201d as a \u201cliberated woman\u201d, a fresh new idea she\u2019s been reading about in <em>Playboy<\/em> magazine. Her journey takes her through a nudist colony, a whisky-drenched jacuzzi party and a brief stretch moonlighting as a chiffon negligee-clad sex worker. Bisexuality gets a visit, along with a Mod photographer\u2019s white Formica-filled apartment and finally, a spectacular orgy. But in this world outside the magazine pages, Barbi encounters a throng of lecherous men: ravenous theatre directors, dick-swinging Freudians, artists. <em>Viva <\/em>is the cuntiest <em>Gesamkunstwerk<\/em> ever made; Biller wrote the script and the soundtrack, made the costumes and the sets, directed and stars as the titular character. The film is a masterpiece, a classically lit staging of the dialectic between sensual optimism and painfully unerotic disappointment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sexual revolution failed. Sex positivity is failing too, argues philosopher Amia Srinivasan in <em>The Right to Sex <\/em>(2021). Broadly speaking, sex positivity is the twenty-first century doxa that all sexual acts conducted between private individuals are ethically sound when buttressed by the pillars of consent and communication. Srinivasan is a faultless researcher. She deploys sickeningly thick datasets and has read everything (Kant, Dworkin, hooks, r\/trufemcels). She is the woke-chic lodestar who made it to the mahogany offices; a recent <em>Vogue UK <\/em>profile opens with her putting down a martini to accept the Chichele Professorship of Social and Political Theory at Oxford. She also looks radiantly heterosexual in all publicity photos, a novel quality rarely attributable to recent public feminist intellectuals. She\u2019s exciting. Contesting the individualism and market logics of liberalism that underpin sex positivity, <em>The Right to Sex<\/em> reaches \u201cback to an older feminist tradition that was unafraid to think of sex as a political phenomenon\u201d. It\u2019s an attempt to resurrect the radical promise of sexual liberation for a generation of underfucked, oversexed zoomers and the millennials plugged in enough to identify with them. In the grand tradition of feminist utopianism, Srinivasan asks readers to \u201c[dream] of a freer sex to come\u201d. The book is watertight. It\u2019s also extremely boring and annoying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This essay is about the shared concerns of <em>Viva<\/em> and <em>The Right to Sex<\/em> \u2014 how the aesthetics and narratives of sexual fantasy relate to actual fucking, and how these are corralled by forces external to the self (patriarchy, racism, capital, <em>Penthouse<\/em>). Why do we want what we want? Can we ever have truly raw, animal sex? Srinivasan is trying to restage the panache of the second wave for an audience sick of the endless dredge of Butlerian performativity. But she has produced a weirdly dour pastiche of a canonical feminist book. Conversely, Biller traffics in fetishistic recreation; her homage to what one critic has called the \u201cbottom feeder cottage industry\u201d of sexploitation flicks made in New York and LA in between 1960 and the early 1970s is impeccable. <em>The Right to Sex <\/em>is attuned to both a pragmatically addressed present and the hallowed concept of radical futurity, but it is <em>Viva\u2019s <\/em>attention to symmetrical hors d&#8217;oeuvres and exuberant pubes that is a more affective vision of emancipatory sexual subjectivity. <em>Viva<\/em> is the better feminist text. By this, I mean that it\u2019s hornier. And by that, I mean that it is a profoundly moving picture of how desire works. Through this cinematic gift, Biller offers two transcendent hours for imagining forms of desire worth desiring. Lockdown isn\u2019t exactly analogous to life as a bored housewife in Los Angeles in 1972, but there are definitely less proximate realities. In these sick, sad times, locating desire, libidinal energy, horniness, whatever you want to call it, couldn\u2019t be more urgent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/10\/29220623\/Viva-Image-1-1620x1080.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2300\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Still from Viva, directed by Anna Biller (US, 2007).<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Dark times: the sex recession and state-mandated celibacy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Viva <\/em>and <em>The Right to Sex <\/em>appear in an epoch of dire material circumstances, erotically speaking. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/article\/20170508-the-many-reasons-that-people-are-having-less-sex\" target=\"_blank\">Recent studies<\/a> found that young people have been having significantly less sex than previous generations. The art critic Dean Kissick <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.documentjournal.com\/2021\/08\/rediscovering-desire-in-a-panopticon-of-virtual-pleasures\/\" target=\"_blank\">ascribed<\/a> the sexual dip in the West to post-GFC precarity and the rise of technology: the alienation produced by Hinge, Tinder, Feeld etc. and the general social perversions of constant phone use. The downward sex trend continues in the pandemic years, a period of state-mandated mass celibacy (spiritual, if not exactly physical). Finally, if you weren\u2019t already struggling to nurse a softie to life, there is the pastel-hued bathos of \u201csex positivity\u201d to contend with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key tenets of mainstream sex positivity are best captured in a novelty product sold by the American feminist sex toy company Unbound. The \u201c<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/unboundbabes.com\/products\/magic-babe-ball\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Babe Ball<\/a>\u201d is an iridescent sea green plastic sphere that costs $12USD and allows pleasure-seeking users to shake and land on \u201cBDSM\u201d suggestions such as \u201cWhisper Something Saucy\u201d. The website notes that the Unbound staff have \u201chandily printed: \u2018Consent matters here. You can always shake again\u2019 around the rim in case you\u2019re not feeling a certain command because, in this house, we play gender-neutral, consent-centered sex games only\u201d. Sure. For the record, there are important gains being made by the girlboss cum industry. But I hold a deep revulsion towards the Magic Babe Ball and all it signifies. It\u2019s partially aesthetic, but also borne of a pragmatic skepticism. Consent, communication, challenging the binary. Tick, tick, tick. What could go wrong here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In research that will surprise no woman, femme or enby who has been on a date recently, Srinivasan finds that for many of her young students, real life experiences of sex often did not align (sometimes violently so) with the ideology of sex positivity. A \u201cdiscourse of empowerment and body confidence masked a deeper sense of disappointment and shame\u201d. And because the discourse was so centered on autonomy and empowerment, Srinivasan\u2019s students\u2019 disappointment was near-impossible to articulate. This makes sense. It\u2019s a taboo dynamic endemic to a certain zillenial milieu, hence why the articulation of it has been met with widespread relief (see Nymphet Alumni\u2019s episode on the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/podtail.com\/en\/podcast\/nymphet-alumni\/ep-3-the-united-states-vs-rookie-mag\/\" target=\"_blank\">mass cultural trauma<\/a> of Tavi Gevinson\u2019s <em>Rookie<\/em> <em>Mag<\/em>; Petra Collins should be burnt on a limited edition SSENSE stake). The gush of media attention directed towards <em>The Right to Sex<\/em> is testament to widespread sexual disillusionment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Srinivasan presents a milquetoast analysis of how the failures of sex positivity function in practice and offers no truly juicy alternatives. One of her primary rhetorical devices is deploying stories about her students to illustrate her theoretical positions (think Maria Tumarkin via Oxbridge and a brow bar). But in hewing to the ethical and privacy dictates of contemporary non-fic, Srinivasan\u2019s anecdotes are leached of detail. She recounts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;After [the] first time I taught a seminar on porn, one of the students visited me in office hours. &#8216;It helped me understand the sex I\u2019ve been having&#8217;, she said. Her ex-boyfriend had always told her she was doing it wrong. &#8216;I see now he wanted me to be like those women&#8217; \u2014 the women in porn. She wasn\u2019t like that&#8230; so he dumped her.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>What sex has this amorphous student been having? What does she want? It is nearly impossible to summon genuine empathy or identification with the ciphers in <em>The Right to Sex<\/em>. Srinivasan also never \u201cwrites personal essays in the contemporary mode\u201d. This is somewhat of a balm in our epoch of compulsive autofiction. But her reluctance to write meaningfully about others or herself illustrates a double bind: to appropriate or to confess? It\u2019s a false dichotomy (quality always absolves), but there are myriad reasons why people use themselves as subjects. It\u2019s easier to be flippant and ergo funny, for one. If Srinivasan really wanted to whip up some of the energy of her second wave predecessors, she could\u2019ve taken (selective) notes from dusty old Germaine Greer in <em>The Female Eunuch <\/em>(1970): \u201cAt all events a clitoral orgasm with a full cunt is nicer than a clitoral orgasm with an empty one, as far as I can tell at least\u201d. Alternatively, Srinivasan could have watched <em>Viva.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/10\/29220717\/Viva-Image-2-1620x1080.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2301\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Still from Viva, directed by Anna Biller (US, 2007).<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>\u201cAre You Honestly Ready for the Sexual Revolution?\u201d<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Biller <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/posts\/56622519\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said<\/a> that she acted in the main role because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking another actress to do what was required to make the film work. Her performanceis incredible. She is a mini-skirted vision in teal eyeshadow who perfectly embodies the formation of female fantasies and the deer-in-headlights agony of their flattening. That other uber-glazed feminine auteur-actress, Dasha Nekrasova, could learn a few things. Barbi spends the first third of <em>Viva <\/em>drinking red wine, smoking cigarettes and looking at soft-core magazines in the bath. What else is a girl supposed to do after she\u2019s done all the morning housework and it\u2019s too early to start cooking for Rick? Sometimes she picks up <em>Playboy <\/em>(as her neighbour Sheila says, \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised\u2026 there\u2019s some very artistic photography!\u201d). But her favourite magazine is <em>Viva.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The origin of the film\u2019s title, <em>Viva <\/em>was an American \u201cInternational Magazine for Women\u201d that ran from 1973 to 1978. It was <em>Penthouse <\/em>founder Bob Guccione\u2019s attempt at a sister publication, part of a haphazard plan to corner the \u201clibber\u201d erotica market. Issues are replete with images taken through Vaseline-smeared lenses to accompany articles such as \u201cWomen Are Into: Total Feminism, Male Nudes, Pubic Hairstyles, Hash Smuggling, Great New Fall Fashions\u201d (August, 1974), \u201cVaginal Exercises: Easy, Erotic, Exclusive!\u201d (October, 1974) and the chiding \u201cAre You Honestly Ready for the Sexual Revolution?\u201d (September, 1974). This was a fantasy life being sold: trade mops, roast dinners and monogamy for freedom and free love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reject tradition, embrace modernity, as the adage once went. Barbi\u2019s husband Rick, played by \u201cChad England\u201d, is a perfect summer barbeque of a man. He is a Ken doll completely content playing golf, making love in missionary and relishing a foot massage after a long, hard day in the office; he is the 1950s. Barbi loves him. But she wants something more. When Rick leaves on a business trip, Barbi decides that it\u2019s time to pursue the life she\u2019s been imagining and joins an escort service in the city.<cite>This was a popular fantasy of 60s and 70s sexploitation flicks: see Joseph Mawra\u2019s 1964 and 1965 Olga trilogy, about a perverted bisexual madam: \u201cThis Movie Shows What Freud Only Hinted At!\u201d<\/cite> Her new pseudonym: \u201cViva, which in Italy means \u2018to live\u2019. Because that\u2019s what I want to do now. To <em>live<\/em>\u201d. To dream of a freer sex, as Srinivasan would say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the 70s men Viva encounters in her brave new world couldn\u2019t care less about female pleasure or the \u201cTotal Feminism Now\u201d features of her magazines. They sniff out Viva\u2019s naivet\u00e9 and manipulate or force her into bed. There are three rapes and one attempted rape in <em>Viva. <\/em>These events, while clearly traumatic, are represented as a matter of fact, unremarkable in the bohemian circles of counter-cultural Los Angeles. \u201cThe sexual revolution\u201d, Biller observed recently, \u201cwas a scam\u201d. For many women, much of the time, it was a period where men felt an extreme, unprecedented entitlement to all women all of the time. As Viva\u2019s creepy neighbour Mark monologues, breaking the fourth wall: \u201cThere has never been a better time to be a man. The willing women. The dandy clothes. The frills. The big rings and jewellery. The open shirts. The sense of entitlement. Take it from me: savour this time, for it will soon be gone, never to return\u201d. The psychedelic organ jazz band goes wild.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viva\u2019s first client with the escort service is a man named Elmer, the charismatic leader of the Healthy Valley Nudist Retreat. Their encounter exemplifies the how the language of liberation is cynically transfigured to serve ulterior motives. The retreat is all hot tubs, timber and ferns. Throughout <em>Viva, <\/em>nearly every actor wears a Nadia Lee Cohen-esque synthetic wig; these firmly styled plastic helmets are most striking in this scene, when all other polyester garments are removed. Everyone\u2019s drinking. Everyone\u2019s nude, but all the women wear heeled sandals. One couple play a floppy game of ping pong. Wandering through a crowd of tufty pussies and shriveled cocks, Viva overhears a man with a nubile young woman on his lap opine that \u201cMarcuse\u2019s foundation is Freud\u2019s principle that our instincts are founded in the pleasure principle of eros, or libidinal energy. Too often, we sublimate this energy to a work impulse&#8230;\u201d (I swear I read something almost identical in <em>SPLM<\/em>, but I digress). Viva finds Elmer, who resembles a lean, dopey John C. Reilly, jamming with a bunch of naked troubadours. After he finishes the track, he takes Viva back to his macram\u00e9-riddled lounge room, puts his prayer beads and kaftan on and sits down to talk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dialogue is straight from the hopeful pages of <em>Viva <\/em>magazine. It makes the subsequent sexual encounter all the more tragic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019d you get hooked up with the agency?\u201d Elmer asks.<br>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d says Viva. \u201cI got in a fight with my husband. That\u2019s when I realised that life could be so much more. That I could be having adventures, instead of just staying home and cooking all the time and waiting for him to come home.\u201d<br>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. That\u2019s very cool. The whole husband and wife thing\u2019s a drag, isn\u2019t it? Puts unnecessary constraints on free love.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A rose by any other name \u2014 \u201cethical non-monogamy\u201d \u2014 would smell as patchouli-cracked. Elmer promptly beginning to maul Viva. She asks him to slow down. She\u2019s not ready. Immediately, he hangs his head in his hands over the back red velvet couch and starts sulking. Free love doesn\u2019t wait! Viva sighs, stands and walks over to strip in front of a large amateur painting of a man performing passionate cunnilingus. Fade to black. In the next scene, in bed, Elmer hits a pipe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI thought I was going to hate myself this morning,\u201d Viva pouts. <br>\u201cBut I don\u2019t. I hate you!\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Life could be so much more than Rick and Swedish meatballs. Just not at the Healthy Valley Nudist Retreat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/10\/29220813\/Viva-Image-3-1620x1080.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2302\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Still from Viva, directed by Anna Biller (US, 2007).<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>\u201cThe first and last fantasy\u2026\u201d<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasies falter. Then what? How does a girl resurrect desire in the wake of abject disappointment, whether from a nudist fuckboy or two years of \u201cdraconian\u201d public health measures? Watching <em>Viva<\/em>, I thought often of the feminist writer Andrea Long Chu, Srinivasan\u2019s most potent intellectual adversary. Both write about how twenty-first century feminism has failed to deal with the complexities of sex. Both are interested in the formation of desiring subjects through narrative, aesthetics and radical political projects. Both turn to second wave theorising to understand these relations better. Their pet examples are different: Srinivasan is fixated on incels, a subculture with an entirely outsized grip on the cultural imaginary, while Long Chu has written extensively on the connections between historic lesbian feminism and current trans politics. Yet they both orbit a central idea. Desires are not just, as the sex positive model would have it, something primordial to the individual. That people just want what they want cannot be accepted ipso facto; desire is often more flexible \u2014 about want and circumstances, rather than preordained need \u2014 than is politically efficacious to admit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of these zeitgeisty alignments, the pair are deeply at odds. Srinivasan spends pages of <em>The Right to Sex <\/em>responding to Long Chu. She always employs a tone of courtly millennial debate, but in the spirit of nostalgia you could try to imagine this interaction as a bare-knuckle discursive shit-fight (Buckley vs. Vidal, Paglia vs. Sontag, Schmidt vs Hurst etc.). At length, Srinivasan quotes Long Chu\u2019s response to her 2018 <em>London Review of Books<\/em> article, also titled \u201cThe Right to Sex\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cObviously something like \u2018no fats, no femmes, no Asians\u2019 is a desire that has a history, and has a politics, that can be described by reference to political processes: imperialism, white supremacy, and also, like, the world-historical defeat of the female sex &#8230; [But it\u2019s] really fucking hard to figure out a way to tell people to change their desires that isn\u2019t moralistic.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Srinavasan rebuts with typically arch proceduralism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIs there no difference between \u2018telling people to change their desires\u2019 and asking ourselves what we want, why we want it, and what it is we want to want? Must the transformation of desire be a disciplinary project (willfully altering our desires in line with our politics) \u2014 or can it be an emancipatory one (setting our desires free from politics)?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter sounds technically appealing. Nobody wants to argue against emancipation. And yes, we can all agree that desire is (partially) formed by forces external to the self, and that these forces are political. The major conflict is how to respond. Srinivasan, although she would probably deny this, ultimately believes it is possible to unpeel fantasy from sexual fact or get <em>beyond <\/em>fantasy; set desire \u201cfree\u201d from politics. But, let alone the charge of moralising, is this even possible?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to <em>Viva. <\/em>There are two genuinely erotic scenes in the film<em>, <\/em>stolen moments where the optimism of Barbi\u2019s bath time fantasies are resuscitated<em>. <\/em>The first is her seduction by Agnes, a bisexual \u201cAmazon beauty\u201d in the swingers\u2019 party set. They first make eyes across a steamy jacuzzi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cHey beautiful,\u201d Agnes says, before offering a gentle warning to Viva about the pitfalls of her new scene.<br>\u201cI can take care of myself!\u201d Viva says. Sure, little libber.<br>\u201cThat\u2019s good&#8230;\u201d Agnes replies. \u201cBecause you look like someone who needs taking care of. By someone who knows how.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She places Viva\u2019s hand on her breast. This foray into what neighbour Mark derides as \u201cfilthy lesbianism\u201d is a respite, a queer salve in a hellpit of sideburned molestation. No other lover could slip off Viva\u2019s feather boa with such tenderness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second heroic rehabilitation of fantasy appears in the penultimate scene of the film, when Viva performs a musical number at an orgy held at a moated castle in the Hollywood Hills. Imagine Russ Meyer\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o60QOHtq3ws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls <\/em>party<\/a> \u2014 topless chicks, weak-chinned men in silk scarf neckties, couples humping in every corner. Transplant the crowd to vaguely medieval mise-en-scene. It\u2019s a miscellaneous costume theme party. There is a man in a Greco-Roman robe; a woman in a chainmail minidress; a pan-piping satyr in a layer of thin green body paint and golden lycra briefs. Drums start. A group of pseudo-primitive, leopard-print loinclothed dancers jump onto a central stage, surrounding Viva. She wears a golden bikini and a huge, half-spherical golden headdress, like the ritual garment of a pagan goddess who\u2019s been through the Spotlight sequin isle or the gilded halo of Renaissance Madonna. The first time I saw this, I shed a tear at Biller\u2019s transcendent vision. Rather than withdrawing or forcibly reshaping her desires away from an oppressive set of political circumstances, Viva recognises the futility of her situation. She finds a perverse form of liberation through embodying a maxed-out version of the meagre fantasy apparatus available. Everyone at the orgy stops to watch her siren song.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Far away there is a drum!<br>I can hear it go thrum thrum thrum!<br>It echoes the beating of my heart!<br>I want to dance until the deep, deep throbbing starts!<br>Oh, my heart aches,<br>Oh, I want you to take me now!<br>While the evening is ripe and full and heavy like a luscious fruit!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Viva extends her arms, winds her outstretched hands in circles, pouts. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Do with me what you will,<br>Do it all!<br>I can\u2019t stop myself from throbbing,<br>Like a tender shoot,<br>Like a rosebud unfolding,<br>Like a Venus fly-trap of love,<br>Holding you, also throbbing, in my thrall!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/10\/29220855\/Viva-Image-4-1620x1080.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2303\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Still from Viva, directed by Anna Biller (US, 2007).<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance captures the shifting structures of desire far more compellingly than anything in <em>The Right to Sex<\/em>. There is an erotic irony to the contrast between the passive self-abnegation of the lyrics \u2014 \u201cdo with me what you will, do it all\u201d \u2014 and the power of Viva\u2019s presence. Barbi the housewife and her desires have been transformed, from suburban ing\u00e9nue to self-aware showgirl. Srinivasan knows that complete sexual emancipation is probably unattainable \u2014 she writes \u201cfreer\u201d more often than \u201cfree\u201d \u2014 but I think she holds out too much hope. It is an error to think that desires or fantasies can ever be set totally free from external forces. Transformation, rather than emancipation, is more realistic. Long Chu says it best:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>[T]he question is never how to get rid of fantasy; the first and last fantasy, after all, is that fantasy is something you can do without. The question is how to make adjustments in fantasies without totally breaking them, or how to survive a shift from one fantasy to another, or sometimes, just how to survive the fantasy you\u2019re already in.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way of putting this: horniness always adapts. Or, as Lacan once said, the desiring subject is always going to be constituted by lack, now put your headdress on and dance for me, baby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong><em>Viva <\/em>la revolution<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a sign of good faith to finish, I\u2019ll acknowledge that Srinivasan has some good ideas. In particular, she reiterates that liberal feminist political demands often have unintended material effects; they are absorbed by capital to produce even more exploitation, even more alienated and atomised working conditions. The classic example of this is the entrance of middle-class feminists in the West to the labour market from the 1970s onwards, precipitating the shift where a single-wage household became the exception rather than the suburban norm. In <em>Viva, <\/em>the most astonishingly dated thing isn\u2019t the rampant sexual abuse or the golden lycra orgies. It\u2019s the pools. Or, rather, the hours and hours that the characters spend frolicking in them. The sheer abundance of their leisure time. Barbi experiments with free love for weeks on end because she doesn\u2019t have to work. Regarding sex positivity, who cares if your partner will validate your queer identity if you can\u2019t get time off to fuck? <em>Viva<\/em> is anti-precarity porn. It\u2019s enough to make a girl update the credit card details for her bounced union membership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My official business here is criticism. But unofficially, I\u2019ve been searching for libidinal energy, inspiration to take me out of the depths of the longest lockdown in the world and into a summer of collective exhilaration. We have been living through dark, dark times, man. But hey, the times they are a-changin\u2019. <em>Viva <\/em>is supposed to be about the misery the sexual revolution produced for the ordinary women who lived through it, but I have to admit that I\u2019ve been using it as a fantasy blueprint for how to live well. Jacuzzis, robes, romance, a continuous stream of spirits. Heavy lidded blinking (very erotic). Orgies. Dionysian excess in miniskirts. Leisure; pleasure. Viva! Sorry Srinivasan, but rights, politics, justice\u2026 it\u2019s been a very difficult winter. We can do total liberation later. For now, just put your fingers in my mouth. Pour me another drink. Please. Viva: \u201cwhich in Italy means \u2018to live.\u2019 Because that\u2019s what I want to do now\u201d. No revolutions, no positivity, just fantasy, ecstasy and a summer of love. Viva!<\/p>\n",

Network Spirituality&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The year is 2020, 2021 or 2327.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre 2020, Heidegger wrote on the necessity for reinvigorating the question of \u201cBeing\u201d in metaphysics. He explicated &#8220;Being&#8221; as the most universal and emptiest of concepts for it defies any attempt at a unanimous definition. I am reminded of the internet since it is also universal and empty.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2327 the most universal concept is Network Spirituality, which like \u201cBeing\u201d escapes coherent denotation. I am not saying that \u201cBeing\u201d = Network Spirituality. I am saying that with the State of Content in the year 2327, Network Spirituality is in the process of becoming the metric for \u201cBeing\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miya Black Hearted Metal Angel Baby (aka @BPD_GOD aka @Borderline_Personality_God) translates Network Spirituality as a mindset adapted to living on the internet. The atypical personality type develops through a multitude of online voices, speaking through separate mediums from across the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network Spirituality is the cultivated conscience of us all when we are posting. There is a collective sense of limitlessness when we are operating across the networks. We post with the efficiency of a pen that has burst and splattered black ink all over beige Issey Miyake pants (maybe they are Zara&#8230; the liquid will disperse just the same). We post with the efficiency of taking a Vitamin C tablet to counter&nbsp; hours upon hours online doxxing; by that, I mean pointless.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network Spirituality could be the path before us, the gate between us, the light at the end, and the end, period.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/08\/09232644\/Cara.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2229\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My first word was \u201cmine\u201d.

But I have been overwhelmed by \u201cmine\u201d my whole life. And I assume we have all always been overwhelmed by our individual \u201cmine\u201d so that in actuality all our first words, like Cara\u2019s, were \u201cmine\u201d.&nbsp; Maybe this collective \u201cmine\u201d is Network Spirituality or it\u2019s just ass, cringe, thrashed etc etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. The Divine Mortality of the Unread and Unwritten<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Unread and Unwritten are among us in 2020-21, but in 2327 we are all unread and unwritten. Two cue points are necessary. The first is contained in Sandy Hook school shooter Adam Lanza\u2019s compiled posts<em> <\/em>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/schoolshooters.info\/sites\/default\/files\/lanza_posts_2.2.pdf\">Shocked Beyond Belief<\/a>&#8220;. In reply to the question, \u201cDo you hate comic sans?\u201d Lanza writes, \u201cI hate every facet of language, along with the entire concept of aesthetics.\u201d The second cue is in <em>Confessions <\/em>by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He writes that \u201can infinity of sensations were familiar to me without processing any precise idea of the objects to which they relate \u2014 I had conceived nothing \u2014 I had felt the whole.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Lanza\u2019s rejection of language comes from a deep disdain for all aesthetic signifers. Rousseau\u2019s seems to express a breakdown between signifier and signified, yet retains an ability to process some sort of transcendental(?) meaning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facet of language \/ entire concept of aesthetics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had conceived nothing \/ I had felt the whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/08\/09232519\/bella-1920x528.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2227\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cSometimes I wonder, do the trees get sad when they see leaves fell?\u201d<\/em><br>\u2014 Bella Hadid, 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Visual representation of conceiving nothing but feeling the whole aka The Divine Mortality of the Unread\/Unwritten aka precursor to The State of Content in 2327)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I also wonder. Yes, I wonder if the leaves are sad they also fell. And maybe when on the internet one is always in some process of felling. She knew this before we did, because great beauty always knows the beyond.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theory of the unread, as Jonty Tiplady denotes in<em> <\/em>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/xn--wgiaa.ws\/3-jonty-tiplady-notes-on-cancel-culture\">Notes on Cancel Culture<\/a>&#8220;,<em> <\/em>ignited further with the contemporary phenomenon of cancellation. Cancel culture = do not listen, watch or read, do not pay attention to the person\/s it\u2019s calling upon. \u201cMost events of cancellation involve unreading, a willed or automated refusal to read,\u201d writes Tiplady. The phenomenon of cancel culture has proved that reading in the modern world is not about understanding. Instead, it\u2019s about the refusal of context: unreading.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State of Content in 2327 is produced solely out of context, by the unread, alone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. The Fungibility of the Cancelled aka \u201cautomated angels\u201d aka the temporality of discourse aka doxxed online again bitch (aka who cares?)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lately, a few friends have stated that they wish to be cancelled. Whether this is true or not is besides the point, for it sheds light on an essential axiom of the cancellation phenomenon. Pre-2020, Tiplady envisioned the fungibility of all cancellees, as a result of the monotonous repetition of calling out again, and again, and again. Inherent amnesia spawns from each cancellation. The context is murky, we forget the actual reason for the cancellation. Perhaps there was no reason? Perhaps there was no cancellation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut the vector I am tracking is what else cancellation might be \u2014 a Rococo faith? An automated response? An angelic sublation?\u201d writes Tiplady. \u201cFinally, the cancelled ones, the post-cancelled go down in history as something like automated angels.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020-21, the trajectory is as follows \u2014 subject of cancellation &gt; unread context &gt; cancellation &gt; extinction &gt; amnesia &gt; automated angelicisim. In 2327, perhaps there are only \u201cautomated angels\u201d. So when people wish cancellation upon themselves, they wish for a type of Angelicism that exists beyond time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/08\/09232613\/4-881x1080.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2228\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Little softer around the edges these days because holiday mode.&nbsp;<\/em><br>\u2014 Byron Bay, 2021<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Visual representation of an \u201cautomated angel\u201d in 2327)<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Melbourne Cancellation Event that occurred earlier in the year is indicative of the temporality of all discourse in 2020-21, and is therefore also crucial to 2327. I will spare you the details as they are generic and repetitious. It happened before, it will happen again, it is always-already in the process of happening. However, the event is emblematic of: Subject of cancellation &gt; unread context &gt; cancellation &gt; extinction &gt; amnesia &gt; automated angelicisim. To be cancelled in Melbourne means a six-day retreat to Bryon Bay (or the surrounding area) and a return to a city plagued with amnesia to continue blissfully unreading and unwriting in a state of angelic automation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I too feel a little softer around the edges. Not because holiday mode but because \u201cautomated angel\u201d mode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Temporality of Discourse, as it is addressed in <em>Being and Time, <\/em>is crucial to cancel culture as a process of amnesia. For Heidegger discourse expresses itself in language by addressing the present environment in a concernful tone. He writes that \u201cdiscourse in itself is temporal, since all talking about\u2026, of\u2026, or to\u2026 , is grounded in the ecstatical unity of temporality.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discourse around cancelled subject XXX did not last, as exhibited by that Melbourne Cancellation Event. Since discourse runs adjacent to the present cultural environment, it will be forever plagued with the problematics of temporality. The monotonous cycle of cancel X, then cancel Y, then cancel Z is destined for amnesia and the automation apparatus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doxxed\u2026, online\u2026., again\u2026., bitch aka who cares\u2026,?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. 5 Generational Warfare <\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>(5GW)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/08\/09233818\/vote-1920x792.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2231\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>(Visual representations of 5 Generational Warfares in the State of Content in 2327)&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will participate, I promise.

In 2327, there will be no threat of traditional warfare, i.e. uniformed soldiers, machine guns, weapons of mass destruction, tactical operation centres, military-industrial complexes, etc etc. Instead, the threat lies solely in the manipulation of perception, the blurring of the real and unreal, and altering or complete removal of any context.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This modern warfare is detailed in <a href=\"https:\/\/au1lib.org\/book\/11774828\/95929c?id=11774828&amp;secret=95929c\"><em>The Handbook of 5GW<\/em><\/a><em> <\/em>as \u201cmoral and cultural\u201d, where perception and context are the key weapons. \u201cIn 5GW, violence is so dispersed that the losing side may never realize it has been conquered\u201d, writes Daniel Abbott.

This entropic ass content prediction will be fulfilled through two distinct methods:&nbsp;<br>1. Opinionless or unopinion<br>2. Perpetual contradictions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opinionless\/unopinion:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Marguerite Duras\u2019 novel <em>The<\/em> <em>Lover, <\/em>the narrator believes writing as a moral act is in the past and \u201cnowadays it often seems writing is nothing at all\u201d. aka The Divine Morality of the Unread and Unwritten aka the idea that language could speak of something, anything, in a meaningful way aka historical ass extinct ass writing.

We are always-already in this process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perpetual contradictions:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State of Content in 2327 lives in a perpetual realm of contradictions. Whatever one says online is contradictory in some way to their motivations previously enacted online. In 2327,&nbsp; all actions, whether conscious or not, will be online. The state of&nbsp; perpetual contradictions will be an inescapable labyrinth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/08\/09233914\/8-1073x1080.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2232\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Showing appreciation to my babies&nbsp;<\/em><br><em>reminder:don\u2019tB&lt;rude&gt;<\/em><br><em>(I don\u2019t usually take pics in the Labyrinth,&nbsp;<\/em><br><em>but the light was hitting her so beautifully\u2026)<\/em><br>\u2014 Bella Hadid, 2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am copying the internet again.

Whacking a bit of something congealed on a plate for friends, hypothetical friends and critics isn\u2019t so bad, but there is no escaping the knowledge that our creative secretions are the nectar of our godless god. I keep finding munching negation machines everywhere. The university gorging on my labour (whether I\u2019m sincere or not), Lacan\u2019s bitter Hegel, billionaires masticating Byron Bay, the forever-chemicals raining on the great lakes, human cattle yard units gnawing on the internal corners of Brunswick, cybernetics constitutively, Irigaray on the Plato-to-Freud pipeline, in Sam\u2019s opinion my mother, the banal finality of the form\/content distinction we\u2019re all routed into suckling the smartphone twitter teat blah blah blah. The outside is prefigured and we know it; that anyone still writes is a tragic miracle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic of the negation machine is as follows: it is a machine that eats the outside, it assumes that what exceeds the systematicity of its informational structure will be eventually negated in its particularity and apprehended by that structure as information. You know, like Gucci window dressings awash with scenes of passionately cool protestors in impeccably agonistic plaid, how resistance to capital is prefigured as a desirable, commodifiable aesthetic. What does this machine feed on though, exactly? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a negation machine, though I do feel I\u2019m being munched. I think it\u2019s a sex thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider Russell\u2019s paradox: if I have a set, essentially just a nominated aggregate, say the set of all women who write about their mothers, then the <em>set <\/em>of all women who write about their mothers is not one of these women, so isn\u2019t included in the set. But consider a different set, the set of all things which aren\u2019t women writing about their mothers. This set includes itself; it is not writing about its mother. Things all seem fine, and Frege (the author of \u201cset theory\u201d, now called \u201cna\u00efve set theory\u201d thanks to Russell) was quite excited about it. But then Russell wrote Frege that infamous letter, a paean to the problem of the mother, I reckon, in which he asked: what about the set of all sets that do not include themselves, does it include itself?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, Frege was a mathematician and logician trying to logicise maths, as numbers were still kind of magical, and it behoved a man of science to see this amended. The set of all sets: we have the set of all women who write about their mothers, which doesn\u2019t include itself, as we have already encountered, and we have the set of all things which are not their mothers, which does include itself. Frege dreamed a wily dream that using this kind of logic could make everything work: all that exists could be ensconced in a water-tight matrix of syllogisms, this thing in this set, that thing in that, all the way down, forever more. A dream of a good night\u2019s sleep<cite>\u201cAnyone can just take a look at any sleeping animal to realise that sleep is designed to suspend the ambiguousness that there is in the body\u2019s relation to itself, namely the deriving of jouissance therefrom.\u201d Jacques Lacan, 2018, Seminar XIX Or Worse\u2026, Polity, 193.<\/cite> that never ends. But Russell knew he was still awake, and so asked: does the set of all sets that do not include themselves include <em>itself<\/em> in its own set? Does the envelope of the world contain itself? Does the envelope of the daughter contain herself, daughters all the way down\u2026 Can we write the new. I\u2019m asking, does the munching negation machine contain itself?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, set theory is to be distinguished from the predicate logic of class. By this I mean the logic of those who might call a woman an adult human female. They <em>know, <\/em>they go <em>so hard<\/em>, they have found two beautiful predicates, adult and female, to attach to the attribute woman, which then finds its home in the warmly god-gaze of the universal, \u201chuman\u201d. All shines down brilliant and bright from this singular sun, the horror of the munching negation machine is shielded by the infinite light of that brightest nothing over a nothing, the signifier human over the void of what-the-fuck. This is predicate logic, the logic of what in set theory are called classes, which are distinguished from sets. The attribute apple has the predicates redness and roundness, which distinguish them from other fruits <em>as<\/em> apples. And likewise, women are definitely shiny, round and red adult females, always better if the juices stream down the chin. It is good to be clean. \u201cSets\u201d, unlike classes, aren\u2019t defined by predicates, but are aggregates that follow the logic of membership. The set of all fruits contains apples, maybe women, but it doesn\u2019t aim at Being. There is no question of the copula, what a thing <em>is<\/em>, but rather the concern is merely with whether it is <em>included<\/em> in the set or not. Being, or the universal, is therefore not the referent; the ultimate referent is irrelevant as membership is not concerned with the fundamental taxonomy that underlines the notion of class, but merely arbitrary groupings. Set theory leaves hermeneutic suspicion at the door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This focus is on the question of membership alone, and not what qualifies membership, in some ways this mirrors (contra the predicate-fascism of the TERFs) the (post-)performativity notion of gender in which a woman is no more than what woman does, and she does what we say she is.<cite>Stryker &amp; Whittle, 2006, The Transgender Studies Reader, Routledge, 10.<\/cite> But this is still a little too sceptical, and therefore philosophical, for Lacan, who considers the issue thusly: there are apparently these things called women, and it\u2019s impossible to know what they want. Women are like sets that include themselves, they can\u2019t be universalised because there\u2019s no exception that could enclose their outside. <em>The set of all things which are not men includes itself. <\/em>We know what men want, they want money, fame, power and hole. Their desire is sustained by imagining someone who has all these things in infinite supply.<cite>To be a bit belabourious, in Lacan\u2019s infamously tedious Seminar XX \u201csexuation graphs\u201d, he defines man as he whose existence has an exception, a fantasised exception to the rule of castration, and he relates this through Freud\u2019s story of the Primal Father\/Primal Horde, in which a primeval band of brothers come together to kill their father for monopolising all the women. Integral to Lacan\u2019s man is the latent presence of this myth of there being one whose cock is always good for it, and everyone knows it. So, he perhaps (this is kind of in Seminar XIX but I\u2019m really stretching it) is like a set which doesn\u2019t include itself\u2014the set itself stands apart from its aggregate, much like that primal father. The set of all men who have killed their father because he was too chad.<\/cite> Perhaps, then, they are like the set which doesn\u2019t include its object-cause of desire, the set which doesn\u2019t include itself. The logic of the signifier, the word, the position of the universal, requires the set-that-doesn\u2019t-include-itself logic, as there is an exclusion in the form of the set itself, which stands against those things included in the set and encloses them as a \u201cwhole\u201d, as an \u201call\u201d. Woman isn\u2019t orchestrated by any such exclusions, for Lacan. For woman, the object-cause of desire isn\u2019t over there, excluded, closing off a totality. It remains internal. She is included in her own set. She is not-whole, there is an intimate exteriority which defines her, prevents her from closing up, maybe, and this logical oddity can therefore not, strictly speaking, be said to exist.<cite>Lacan, 1975, Le S\u00e9minaire. Livre XX. Encore, 1972-73. Ed. Jacques-Alain Miller. Paris: Seuil, 68.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TERFs are part of the lineage who think to define woman as lacking this structural coherence, access to psychic universality etc., is sexist. Queer theory was in part born from the ashes of debates between those who took this non-coherent, non-universalisable, predicateless notion of women seriously, namely Lacan and his detractors. If you don\u2019t believe me, consider the premise of <em>Gender Trouble<\/em>: that no notion of \u201cwomen\u201d can ground feminist theory and politics without excluding someone it means to capture. Whilst responding to many more concrete contexts and struggles than Lacan probably ever dared to dream to schematise, Butler\u2019s thesis is surely, in part, an Anglo extension of <em>the woman does not exist<\/em>. Butler universalises this position of non-existence, melting the problem of the pure difference of sex, at least in the formal sense of her psychoanalytic interlocutors, down into the flat multiple of gender. The idea of gender nullifies an operative difference here that can\u2019t be understood via the logic of predicates (as Butler knew but the TERFs forgot), but just because predicates are dumb when it comes to defining sex, this doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t difference at play, that there isn\u2019t a systematicity to be reckoned with. In universalising <em>woman does not exist, <\/em>queer theory leaves the corollary question in relation to men and the universal unattended. Men (white\u2026) <em>have<\/em> kind of grounded history, assumed the universal, the historical form of politics. Surely the notion that we can flatten this position into one identity among many speaks to a kind of moment of historical abstract mediation that is more symptomatic than liberatory. I can\u2019t really claim Lacan has teeth on this problem either, but he seems alight to the fact that even if the content of the pure difference of sex cannot be pinned down with some kind of wishful-thinking metaphysic, neither can the paradoxical heart of the universal be wished away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this juncture, Lacan turns to the logic of the set, and to this question of the paradox of the set of all sets, and the impossibility of answering the question of whether this set does or does not include itself, to think sex. If we try to think the set of all sets that don\u2019t include themselves, the set of all of man, we see that this set excludes itself from membership. If I include the set of all sets that don\u2019t include themselves, it becomes a set which includes itself. It disappears. Desiring, now, from the other side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea Long Chu in <em>Females<\/em> is, as such, indubitably set theoretical. When she tries to think the set of all sets that don\u2019t include themselves, or the totality of man, she comes up with a beautifully Russellian answer: everyone is <em>Female<\/em>. The totality of man, everyone, moves from the masc universal (which doesn\u2019t include itself) to the place of woman, a set that does include itself, ending in disaster and paradox. Everyone is female. This is to say, for Chu, that everyone desires someone to do their desiring for them, that being female is to sacrifice something of the self to make a space in which to host the desires of another. With this ratbag soothsaying, like Lacan, instead of chickening out, (e.g., capitulating to predicate logic like white feminists scared of losing their identitarian claim to capital because the cat girls are fucking with the definition of woman), Chu resists the cult of poststructuralist dissolution and formalises the paradox. Everyone is Female, but not all females are women. I think we need this weird washed-up structuralism to meet the munching negation machine head on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve finally written an abstract for my thesis, I\u2019m realising it as we speak:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking along a headland just after my mum nearly died. The sunset is beautiful but I\u2019m too aware of the performance involved in taking beauty seriously to go there, so I awkwardly meditate on the mediating alienation instead.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is exciting. It\u2019s not. Its cathartic but you can probably already tell that from where I\u2019m standing, catharsis always peters out into the swill of layered abstractions too quickly for anything to actually move. I\u2019m writing an MA on Luce Irigaray and all I see in her work is mediation, the mediation between something which has the potential to be different, a new that is beyond novelty, a difference that could *make a difference*, and the negation munching machines that stillbirth it all as the same old shit before we can even be moved. Particularly, essentially, moved at the level of speaking. So that we might speak a language other than mimesis, parroting. Being aware of the performance involved in witnessing a difference that could make a difference, getting caught in the alienation of a sunset\u2019s beauty after near-bereavement, for example, leaves one with the option to either fall into nihilism or try to mobilise that performance imperfectly, maybe even disgustingly, to push the performative form to its parodic, bombastic extreme. This is the route taken by performativity, patron lifestyle-methodology of queer theory, contra nihilism. The nihilism of refusing to not be alienated, to resist catharsis, even parodic catharsis. Both these strategies confront the perfect beauty and absent alienness of the mother, of that heaving artifice called nature, of one\u2019s sex, of all these things that speak to each other, negatively of course, between the lines of cybernetic negation of the excess, though their capture as figural outsideness is always prefigured in the circuit and they know it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it\u2019s convoluted, but this is the move I am trying to stick, or that simply won\u2019t wash off: try and make a set of all sets, and you get a woman, though it\u2019s impossible to say what that is. The resources for the logical coherence of the set are undermined by aiming for the ultimate abstraction, asking the question of sexual difference. Try to think the universality of man and out pops a universal Female. A universal problem of desire. Chu states, then, that we ought understand sexual difference as a difference at the level of phantasmatic defense. She writes,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cEveryone is female, but how one <em>copes with<\/em> being female \u2014 the specific defense mechanisms that one consciously or unconsciously develops as a reaction formation <em>against<\/em> one\u2019s femaleness, within the terms of what is historically and socioculturally available\u2014this is what we ordinarily call <em>gender<\/em>. Men and women must therefore be understood not as unreconcilable opposites, or even as two poles of a spectrum, but more simply as the two most common phyla of the species Females\u201d.<\/p><cite>A.L. Chu, 2019, Females, 12-13.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If we consider this defense against being \u201cFemale\u201d as a defense against castration, then Ladies and Gentlemen, Chu is the Lacanian of our time. Especially if we replace \u201cphyla\u201d with \u201cset\u201d, and understand Females as animals who reproduce in the hollow of lack that is filled with the misrecognised desire of the other, in other words, Lacan\u2019s universally castrated subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But does Chu also just reify a (post\/anti\/something) humanist universal at the end of the day in this figure of the Female? A predicative one, even? I don\u2019t think so, because it serves the function of a formalisation of a paradox. Everyone is female, and everyone hates it. This is what generates the desire, the desire to be other than female, though the lack constitutive of the female is the condition of the possibility of desire as such. To take this one step further, to really fuck with you, perhaps we have never even been female, perhaps the female is also simultaneously the horizon of our desire, this sissy desire to go all the way, as well as the diabolical marker of that which we wish to transcend, whilst <em>also<\/em> being the condition of our desire. With such hysterical demands, the species Female can then be best captured, in logical terms, by na\u00efve set theory and Russell\u2019s paradox. Only the paradox here isn\u2019t the evidence of a bung theory, but a manifestation of the real, the real of desire as contradiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only Bertrand Russell knows why I can\u2019t write my thesis. It is a set of all sets that don\u2019t include themselves, and when I try to gather my desire, that is, gather all these sets which don\u2019t include themselves together into this document, these 30,000 words, I hit the paradox. The thing I desire comes to include itself and therefore ceases to be. Someone once said, I think it was Russell, that there is a red-thread connection between finishing a thesis and killing your mother. A mother is also a Russellian paradox. Try to make a set of her sets and she\u2019s finished. She cannot include herself, even at the level of the set of sets, the word \u201cmother\u201d, for she is defined by including another. Her logic is constitutively inconsistent, but this inconsistency is the mother of all desire: the desire to correct inconsistency, or the desire to express it. The desire for the impossible axiomatisation of set theory, the creation of a metaphysics, or if you\u2019re really lucky, some art. Or fucking, if sublimation is just too gauche. The desire for failure. The desire to be something other than a daughter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose there\u2019s a kind of bad nihilism involved in becoming so obsessed with trying to pin down this contradiction, to put forward this very laboured metaphor, maybe the metaphor of labour, the status of the labourer as the one who produces offspring, or the proletariat. In Latin, <em>proles<\/em> is \u201coffspring\u201d, and <em>proletarius <\/em>is \u201cthe man whose only wealth is his offspring, or whose sole service to the state is as father\u201d. We are, indeed, all females when our ancestral fathers are the midwives to the state. But it\u2019s a bit stultifying to dedicate one\u2019s time to reifying this fact in the discourse of the university, and in such polite company too. If I can\u2019t write my thesis because my essence is contradictory desire, the university knows this and draws my passion from my throat to teach its doomed little zoomers. The dream of the utopic university, a temple for the thrill of the intergenerational exchange of seminal ideas, the birth of the new and not merely the novel, the sanctity of equality before a well-endowed HECS scheme \u2014 my lust for all this has kept me in un(der)paid work as a casual tutor for years. A dream perhaps not to correct inconsistency, nor express it, but share in it. The university\u2019s recognition of the passion of this dream is its business model. We are all females to Duncan Maskell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe this is the problem. How historical is Chu\u2019s shit-posty structuralist anthropology? Have we always been Female, or is this loathsome status the product of a feminised labour market and the decline of capital accumulation\u2019s need for a reserve army of proles, and therefore the requisite strict sexual divisions of labour? Has desire always occupied the hollow of the sacrificial self?<cite>I\u2019m thinking of you, Eva Birch!<\/cite> Maybe we are all females, but let us also consider that maybe we still haven\u2019t quite made it. I think I began by discussing the prefiguration of the outside and I think of this in accordance with the economisation of femaleness, of the capacity for production in that vacant self (sometimes body), of femaleness culturally realised as the lever of a possible circulation of value, even surplus value. Is it possible to imagine the new, creativity, in terms other than value? Can we imagine an opposite for value, beyond its binary of valuable\/valueless? Can we denature its status as master signifier?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t write my thesis and someone important says to me it\u2019s like this: if our mothers are deeply implicated in the formation of our desires and so too the form of our self-destruction, the Eros and Thanatos, Apollo and Dionysus, the jouissance that keeps us eating ourselves, then the desire to write a thesis is the same desire which prevents its being written: the desire for desire, that suspension in infinite potential sustaining all desires, keeping them alive at the cost of any final consummation. It is both carrying on the family tradition of hysteria, dutifully, and carrying on the family tradition of hysteria, in horror. The horror of being a dutiful daughter is the horror of being woman. The horror of being a woman is to wear universal femaleness on one\u2019s sleeve, to shitpost the wounds of the negation machine on the body. But I want to not know what a body can do, again. Speaking should be left for a voice ready to articulate contradiction. I don\u2019t want my body to speak for the family, for anyone, not even me.<\/p>\n",

In how many words again?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cameron Hurst:<\/strong>&nbsp;That\u2019s a dire but accurate description. The VCA graduate show opened for two weeks in December with only \u201cindustry professionals\u201d allowed to visit. This somewhat ironically included students from the University of Melbourne who were chosen to review the exhibition for Memo Review\u2019s Mass Memo project. Each reviewer had 500 words to write on a few artists in a disciplinary section. There were about 100 artists in the Honours and Third Year sections of the Graduate Show, we were only allowed in for about an hour and a half and there were no wall texts or information available about the artists\u2019 intentions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think the point of a review is? Especially in this pandemic context. Is it to provide a comprehensive document of what the show was like for people who couldn\u2019t legally attend? To summarise themes? To pick \u201crising stars\u201d? Maggie Nelson has described art writing as a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/bombmagazine.org\/articles\/maggie-nelson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">performative<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/bombmagazine.org\/articles\/maggie-nelson\/\"> moment<\/a>.\u201d I like this way of thinking about reviewing, where it isn\u2019t framed as a pious public service nor a totalising judgment of worth. Even though it was hard to review a huge, unthemed exhibition in a miniscule word count, it was also a fun constraint. For me, it became a concise exercise in style, perhaps at the sacrifice of considered content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;I think artists \u2014 particularly young artists \u2014 always hope that reviews will perfectly distil the meaning of their works to \u201cthe public\u201d (whether they were able to see it themselves or not), while retaining some of its mystique, showing that it could never be entirely \u201cknowable.\u201d Something they can whack on their CVs and build grant applications with. They don\u2019t care if you achieve some sort of Maggie Nelson performative moment. At other times, they will try to resist interpretation all together and be furious at the thought of your having tried and inevitably failed. There are certain rules about interpretation, but many see it as a task of translation. And in one respect this is true, in that you are not rewriting the text, but you are altering it. But it would be a mistake to reduce art to its content and form \u2014 to try to \u201ctell\u201d \u201cwhat it is.\u201d To attempt a clean \u201ctranslation\u201d is a reductive exercise in making art more manageable. It is better suited to tasks like writing wall decals or the copy for an art fair catalogue (to marketing). For me, the point of an art review is to&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;<\/em>cultural criticism&nbsp;<em>through<\/em>&nbsp;art \u2014 not to translate or rewrite the text, but to create a new one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you did this as best you could in 500 words and maybe having no wall texts was a blessing. You identified what you saw as a \u201cgrotty girl\u201d trend or movement among VCA grads and traced its potential lineage. My friend Kate kind of summed up the issues I had with \u201cgrotty girl.\u201d It\u2019s frustrating because it addresses the artist as the genre rather than the work \u2014 art as a symptom rather than an intentional gesture. From 2016\u201317 a group of us, including some of the artists you reference in your review, Hana Earles and Grace Anderson, ran an Instagram account called \u201cAbject It Girls.\u201d It was a muntdog69-esque joke account, but it was also a kind of cynical gesture in addressing how art (and social media accounts) by women are subject to more biographical scrutiny and critique than male and what it means to be an \u201cIt Girl\u201d in a relatively small town. If we talk about grottiness, what separates the lineage of VCA alumni like Jenny Watson through to Hana, Grace, Evelyn Poggioli, Katherine Botten and new-gen Abella D\u2019Adamo from other simultaneous lineages such as&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/art150.unimelb.edu.au\/articles\/artistic-encounter-jon-cattapan-and-ian-mclean\" target=\"_blank\">Ian McLean<\/a>&nbsp;to Alex Vivian, Christopher LG Hill, Liam Osborne and Josey Kidd-Crowe (maybe new-gen&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/art2020.finearts-music.unimelb.edu.au\/programs\/honours\/edward-dean\" target=\"_blank\">Edward Dean<\/a> after <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BOOHv1JBUdp\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Fidock and Joshua Petherick<\/a>)? Why add the \u201cgirl\u201d qualifier at all? I also see themes of abject masculinity surface in different ways in Liam and Alex&#8217;s work. While all these artists have distinct practices, I feel like \u201ccrusty, grimy, oily\u201d with a touch of saccharine sweet is a mainstay. They\u2019re also often quite text heavy \u2014 &#8220;conceptualists of a materialist bent&#8221;? <cite>Ian McLean, 2017, \u2018Artistic encounter: Jon Cattapan and Ian McLean,\u2019 accessed January 9, 2021, from https:\/\/art150.unimelb.edu.au\/articles\/artistic-encounter-jon-cattapan-and-ian-mclean.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/01\/15022720\/IMGP1865-1440x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1874\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">Christopher LG Hill, <em>window treatment 4<\/em>, as part of consultancy studio, 2011 at NGV, Melbourne. Courtesy of the artist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH:<\/strong>&nbsp;OK. Firstly, a sheepish mea culpa. The obvious issue with \u201cgrotty girl\u201d is that aside from addressing the artist as genre, it addresses the artist as gender, which is reductive and annoying. I actually originally wrote it as \u201cgrotty bitch,\u201d which is a) funnier and b) dislocates gender from gauche biological essentialism into a more conceptual and campy aesthetic terrain (\u201cbitch\u201d is also far more \u201cfucky,\u201d I think). However, it seemed too mean for a Memo grad show reviews of artists I had no personal relationship with. What do you think about that? Would \u201cbitch\u201d have absolved me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;Bitch is still very gendered imo and at least \u201cgirl\u201d is a nod to&nbsp;<em>Preliminary Materials for a Theory of the Young-Girl<\/em> by Tiqqun, which is less gendered but still cringe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH:<\/strong>&nbsp;That Tiqqun&nbsp;<em>Young-Girl&nbsp;<\/em>book exemplifies critical theory camp in its unfortunate failed seriousness. Admittedly it has some good lines, but my god, have these people ever heard of an editor? It&#8217;s a half-baked titillation for stunted hostages of the academy and the graphic design fucking sucks.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/semiotexteofficial?igshid=1wek8y8qs1snf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Semio(<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/semiotexteofficial?igshid=1wek8y8qs1snf\">ugh).<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those other male artists that you\u2019ve listed clearly do orbit around a shared, intentional \u201cgrotty\u201d visual language that is more linked by geography, time and social media than gender. Some of Steven Rhall\u2019s artworks also come to mind. That being said, I think the grad show works (and the older artists who I originally situated them in relation to) do engage with explicitly \u201cfeminine\u201d formal tropes and conceptual concerns. I never saw the Abject It Girls account, but the way you describe it speaks to this irresistible double bind. A form of curdled hyperfemininity is ironically deployed as a kind of meta-engagement with the tropes of \u201cWomen\u2019s Painting\u201d or whatever, but it is deployed nonetheless. The gesture is meant to trouble the need for the gesture, but inevitably reinscribes it and imbues it with new meanings and so on (a Galaxy Brain dynamic).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the VCA show, it\u2019s definitely true that other artists exhibited works that resonated with Abella D\u2019Adamo, Grace Emerald Culley and Savana Szelski\u2019s pieces (the three grotty girls I wrote about). Edward Dean, who you mention as a good example of a new-gen grotty non-girl, had crusty, oily work about signs and signifiers; Levi Franco had a bunch of aphoristic text pieces. I didn\u2019t write about their work because it didn\u2019t fit into my review word count, but even with hypothetical added space: Dean\u2019s work isn\u2019t particularly \u201cgirly\u201d and Franco\u2019s work isn\u2019t really \u201cgrotty.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you initially objected to my use of the term \u201cfucky.\u201d For the record, what is the correct application?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;Ok so obviously it\u2019s a very silly word but for me \u201cfucky\u201d was always something very separate to Abject It Girls. It was in an <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/busprojects.org.au\/media\/pages\/library\/fucky-with-compliments\/a342fdda34-1608103821\/spencer-catalogue-draft-5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">exhibition catalogue<\/a> for Spencer Lai that I tried to invent a fucky etymology and credit where credit\u2019s due: Spencer is my mock destroyer linguist in crime. I describe it in terms as something with \u201cthe quality of being \u2018off\u2019 \u2014 astray, adrift, spoiled, off-the-mark \u2026 art and artists that make the everyday alien, or just a little bit askew, creating environments imbued with an ambient uneasiness as opposed to explicit anxiety or instability.\u201d A slapstick comedy comprised of the collision of people, objects and spaces. Actually, now that I think of it, \u201ccamp\u201d is probably much closer to my definition of \u201cfucky.\u201d In Sontag\u2019s terms camp is \u201cfailed seriousness,\u201d \u201cartifice as an ideal,\u201d an anti-style that finds success in \u201ccertain passionate failures.\u201d <cite>Susan Sontag, 2009, \u2018Notes on \u201cCamp\u201d,&#8217; in <em>Against Interpretation and Other Essays<\/em>, Penguin Books, London, p. 287, 288 &amp; 291.<\/cite> So maybe failure is where fucky, camp and abject collide \u2014 abject being failed Totality, femininity or seriousness and fucky being finding comedy in that failure (but without the ostentatious connotations of camp). But I\u2019m interested to know how you see them as aligned. Chronologically? Socially? Comically?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH:<\/strong>&nbsp;Some of those words you\u2019ve used to describe \u201cfucky\u201d \u2014 \u201coff,\u201d \u201cspoiled\u201d \u2014 are typically abject in a Kristevan sense. Decaying flesh, congealed milk, these are archetypal examples of abjection. Your definition does seems more technicolour and clownish than would be considered classical in the abject palette. When I used \u201cfucky\u201d in the review, I mainly thought it was a funny, bitchy word, but I also considered it in relation to what I see as uncanny, campy craft traditions in Lai\u2019s and others\u2019 work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Felt, graphite, coloured pencils, collage, embroidery, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, denim and plastic (especially miniature plastic objects, especially \u201ccharms\u201d) are all in the \u201cfucky\u201d material taxonomy, right? I\u2019d maybe say Paul Yore fits the bill, but perhaps they\u2019re too crochet camp. Lots of the work in&nbsp;<em>Freedom is the gentle exploration of boundaries\u2026 I wear jeans, T-shirt, fragrance,&nbsp;<\/em>a show organised by Lai<em>&nbsp;<\/em>at Discordia last year, is obvs fucky. That&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.spencerlai.info\/freedom-is-the-gentle-exploration\" target=\"_blank\">catalogue<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.spencerlai.info\/freedom-is-the-gentle-exploration\"> text<\/a>&nbsp;explicitly invokes testing \u201cthe boundaries of the self.\u201d In&nbsp;<em>Powers of Horror,&nbsp;<\/em>Kristeva writes that abjection occurs at the corporeal \u201ccrossroads of phobia, obsession and perversion\u201d of the Self and the Other. It\u2019s almost like \u201cfucky\u201d is a tempering of this raw, guttural process, which is rendered less violent by the addition of Polly Pocket knick-knacks and rainbow flag bags. Yet underneath fashionista stylings, an ambient unsettledness continues to seep through.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;I would say Yore\u2019s work is more camp than fucky in its garish decorativeness and flamboyant queerness. Whereas in&nbsp;Zoe Jackson\u2019s recent show&nbsp;at Bossy\u2019s Gallery (run by Spencer and Madeleine Russo) for example, I think you see what you\u2019ve identified as abject without being necessarily funny\/fucky or camp. Could also add <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amyjaneparker.info\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amy Jane Parker<\/a> to that category.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/01\/15034412\/Bossys_zoe_jackson-9817-1618x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1909\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">Zoe Jackson, <em>Untitled (weapon deposit) \u2014 1 Garden spike, wire, plush heart, marshmallows, resin,<\/em> 2020 at Bossy&#8217;s Gallery, Melbourne.

You mentioned in an earlier conversation that this provisional materialism speaks to lineages of&nbsp;<em>arte povera,&nbsp;<\/em>where anti-bourgeois sentiments played out in structures made from \u201ceveryday\u201d items. Germano Celant, who first theorised the movement, wrote referring to Jannis Kounellis\u2019 work that&nbsp;<em>arte povera&nbsp;<\/em>spoke&nbsp;\u201cthe slang of natural, organic matter\u201d that moved from the \u201c\u2018said\u2019 to the \u2018unsaid.&#8217;\u201d<cite>Germano Celant, 1972, &#8216;Jannis Kounellis,&#8217; Domus, no. 515, p. 55.<\/cite> Germano\u2019s distinction between the \u201csaid\u201d and the \u201cunsaid\u201d articulates another idea I vaguely associated \u201cfucky\u201d with: a focus on subconscious, intuitive practices, as opposed to theory-based, PhDy work. In the interview text that accompanied the&nbsp;<em>Recent Tendencies in Women\u2019s Painting&nbsp;<\/em>show at Guzzler, Hana Earles says that she \u201chates work that is research based.\u201d To rephrase this in the parlance of our times, research is&nbsp;<em>based<\/em>. This is a junction where I see the abject\/fucky overlay. It\u2019s in contrast to artists like Tom Nicholson or Alex Martinis Roe, whose work is more concerned with practices like the interrogation of archives and processes of institutional historicisation. Important and interesting, but not juicy. In terms of&nbsp;<em>arte povera&nbsp;<\/em>\u201ceveryday\u201d materials, the fucky\/abject artists seem to be responding to the globalised supply chains that stock plastic-filled dollar stores. In addition to the enduring grotty efficacy of sticks, dirt and fabric scraps favoured by the Italians, the Melbourne&nbsp;avant-garde&nbsp;enlist Daiso detritus and duct tape.&nbsp;<em>Kawaii arte povo?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;So they\u2019re more research-cringe? I think any anti-intellectualism here is a joke. The fact is, these guys have all done research-based work as a condition of going through the university system. They would have written multiple exegeses where they qualify and contextualise their work&nbsp;<em>with research<\/em>. You can\u2019t de-skill without first being \u201cskilled\u201d in some sense. So even if you are bucking against or rejecting this by employing a stream-of-consciousness automatism in your work, your conscious and subconsciousness has been shaped by your experiences \u2014 including those in higher education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this is comparable to Trump\u2019s appeal to an identitarian working class. A class that is not defined by class-consciousness per se but by the particular identity characteristics that are prescribed to it \u2014 a resentment not of the rich or of capital as the producer of class difference, but of&nbsp;<em>professionals<\/em>&nbsp;(Trump being a non-professional politician who is nonetheless rich\/elite).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH:<\/strong>&nbsp;Hmm, interesting. That point seems like a bit of a leap to me in terms of class (middle America to middle Melbourne? idk), but the rise of anti-professionalism rings true.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;Reminds me of the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard passage where he talks about political intellectuals, \u201cprivileged smooth-skinned types,\u201d inclining towards the proletariat (who would hate them), but who dare not say that \u201cone can enjoy swallowing the shit of capital.\u201d Hana\u2019s most recent show at Meow2,&nbsp;<em>Victim of Late Capitalism&nbsp;<\/em>approaches this idea, I think. In the audio work (accessible via the QR code on the room sheet that leads to a Patreon with a $1 Victim Tier and a $10,000 Patron of the Arts tier), the resentment is directed to a central (professional) authority figure that is a combination of writer, comedian, director, therapist, mother, policewoman (the Big Other) who was named Audrey in an earlier iteration on&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/cumsuppository.blogspot.com\/2019\/03\/birther-play.html\" target=\"_blank\">her<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/cumsuppository.blogspot.com\/2019\/03\/birther-play.html\"> <\/a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/cumsuppository.blogspot.com\/2019\/03\/birther-play.html\" target=\"_blank\">old <\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/cumsuppository.blogspot.com\/2019\/03\/birther-play.html\">blog<\/a>. <cite>She writes in the original: &#8220;my lawyer reading my tarot cards in the courtroom: writer, comedian, director, policewoman &#8230; my therapist decides to become my lawyer &#8230; I get a therapist (played by Audrey and\/or memo review) she adopts me as a 26 yo, she raises me to be her own.&#8221;<\/cite> &#8220;I want more every day.

While it could be argued that these elements constitute the artist\u2019s autobiography, they\u2019re not particularly&nbsp;<em>personal<\/em>&nbsp;signifiers<em>.<\/em>&nbsp;The significance of so-called postmodernist appropriation art that forgoes claims of originality by appropriating existing images and objects is that it exposes the fiction of the \u201cunique individual\u201d and that our senses of self are socially and historically determined by images, discourses and events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a lot of these artists\u2019 work we see highly generalisable Western images (often commodities, advertisements and empty symbols like love hearts) of teenage or preteen girlhood. Ones that don\u2019t refer just to specific autobiographies but to the mass media\/networked technology that proliferated after Y2K. In a truly \u201cunprecedented\u201d way, coming of age came to mean that our primary identification processes were with television and computer\/phone screens. It is a way of coming into being and gaining recognition, not solely through traditional institutions but also through our many dispersed, performative, social and mediatised personae. This is abject in the Kristevan sense \u2014 a process existing somewhere between the concept of the object and subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While identification was perhaps always a struggle between autonomy and deterministic outside forces, there is something in all these artist\u2019s works that hints at the covert enjoyment or&nbsp;<em>jouissance<\/em>&nbsp;to be found in these processes (as with gossip).

Wherever the Grid goes, a certain level of reactionary grot appears. We see this in decentralised art platforms like&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/soloshow.online\/index.html\">Solo<\/a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/soloshow.online\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Show<\/a>. The formal and structural qualities of the platforms we engage with are constantly shaping our sensibilities, equally or more than their content \u2014 the potential for anonymity; the inbuilt assumption that anything can be copied, pasted and recontextualised; the primacy and gargantuan scope of image sharing; the potential for state censorship or surveillance depending on location and platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, the content is clearly important. Your invocation of \u201cWestern images of teen and preteen girlhood,\u201d and the listing of brand names and TV show characters in the Earles&nbsp;<em>un&nbsp;<\/em>mag piece speak to this. They\u2019re part of a shared lexicon inflected by a culture of hyperconsumption. This reminds me of something I observed on a flight recently. A tween girl in the seat next to me was playing a&nbsp;<em>MyScene-<\/em>esque game on her personal iPad which involved giving a makeover to a sexy animated female corpse (surely the penultimate Abject It Girl). My neighbour laboured over whether to pick orange or purple nail polish for her cadaver. All the best lip colours for grey skin tones were tragically paywalled. She peeked up at her Dad to suss whether he would give over the credit card, then decided the better of it. It was a perfect iteration of how feminine subjectivities are shaped by online life; a solitary fantasy of gendered identity construction as a process of accrual (<em>I wear jeans, Tshirt, fragrance)<\/em>, mediated by access to Daddy capital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abella D\u2019Adamo\u2019s work, replete with branded, adolescent eroticism, represents what this preteen iPad gamer can graduate to in a few years&#8217; time.&nbsp;<em>teen amateur makeout stick and poke<\/em>, D\u2019Adamo\u2019s video work, zooms on two teens passionately humping in an abandoned field. Crucially, the girl wears Cheap Monday jeans. The best art about the internet is never a literal, indexical re-staging of the digital in the art space (death to memes in galleries) but work that physically captures some intangible sensibility of what it means to be online. In D\u2019Adamo\u2019s work you can feel the deluge of images she\u2019s scrolled through, even though the end result is a single figure or a one-channel video. This digital inflection isn\u2019t present in the work of other, older artists we\u2019ve mentioned like Jenny Watson, but I think it clearly starts to come through with artists like Chris Hill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/01\/29011549\/Dd001108_RGB-833x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2013\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">Jenny Watson, <em>A woman&#8217;s work is never done + I feel like when my father used to dry my hair<\/em>, 1992.

Gossip is seen as trivial or intellectually unproductive, something that is generally understood as an intimate or personal way of talking between women. Of course, he sees that as horny because it\u2019s something he does not have access to \u2014 a definition from the outside. Despite being the biggest gossip in Melbourne, he never really has the juice. Anyway, it\u2019s just like abject: women are considered more abject\/grotty because there\u2019s a societal expectation to have more dignity or composure and when men gossip, it\u2019s not trivial, it\u2019s intel \u2014 because their words have more weight.

Asking for a friend. I moved here from Perth a few years ago, so I don\u2019t know the interpersonal dynamics of local art history pre-2017. They don\u2019t teach Suicidal Oil Piglet in the Art History classes at UniMelb (yet).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;I don\u2019t think you need to be \u201cinside\u201d the network to comment on it, but I do think you need to understand it contextually. In Howard Becker\u2019s terms, the \u201cArtWorld&#8221; is a network of cooperative links between institutions, artistic production, reputation building, circulation, distribution, consumption, interpretation and evaluation. <cite>Howard Becker, 1982, <em>Art Worlds<\/em>, University of California Press, Berkeley, 34.<\/cite> Which is why much politically engaged art concerns the art world itself \u2014 a hermeticism that speaks primarily to those within that world. While these cooperative links were seemingly expanded post Y2K, there\u2019s something that remains particular. It hasn\u2019t been a process of acculturation so much as syncretism.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a participatory culture, these artists transform the more \u201cglobal\u201d experience of media consumption into the production of new texts and communities that remain culturally specific, while absorbing the signifiers of more global cultures that they affirm while they protest. I think you can see a really clear comment on this in Zac Segbedzi\u2019s eternally self-referential (and gossipy!) work like,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https:\/\/artviewer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Zac-Segbedzi-at-Jennys-Los-Angeles-13.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The provincial subjects strike their self conscious poses in hopes of being validated \/ Early Career Group Show<\/a><\/em>, which was shown outside of the Melbourne-context in <a href=\"https:\/\/artviewer.org\/zac-segbedzi-at-jennys\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2019 at Jenny&#8217;s<\/a> in Los Angeles and features the likeness of Hana, Calum Lockey, Natasha Havir-Smith, Grace Anderson, Liam Osborne and Kat Botten. (RIP to the aptly titled melbournefineartgossipblog).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think Zac\u2019s audiences in Los Angeles needed to get the interpersonal drama in order to understand the premise of subcultural identity, competitive provincialism and international\/institutional validation. But they\u2019d definitely miss some of the nuances, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. I think of Terre Thaemlitz\u2019 \u201cSecrecy Wave Manifesto\u201d where she argues that in our quest for visibility, we have lost the cultural value of secrets, which preserve subculture within the social dynamics of minor communities. Thaemlitz meant this specifically in relation to queer spaces and curbing the indiscriminate distribution of her work online, but perhaps we could think of it in terms of the work\u2019s actual content when it comes to Zac\u2019s show. Even gossips have secrets. Perhaps they\u2019re the most secretive of all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/01\/15222445\/mg_3737_1st-edit-1620x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1933\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">Grace Anderson, [detail] <em>leave a message<\/em>, 2020 in <em>What is this hip-cock?

I don\u2019t think an art writer or reader needs (or wants) to know the various interpersonal dramas of a scene to engage with the work coming out of it, but understanding \u201csubcultural identity, competitive provincialism and international\/institutional validation\u201d as general features of (anti)professional artistic life is pretty important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, back to the gossipy section of the docket. Interest in \u201cgossip\u201d in practice doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly gendered. Doomer Dad Giles\u2019 Mass Memo review was fixated on gossipy interactions as a result of quarantime repression. And in the <a href=\"http:\/\/guzzler.net.au\/exhibitions\/recent-tendencies-in-women-s-painting\">Guzzler interviews<\/a>, David Homewood said that Evie Poggioli\u2019s work \u201cmakes [him] think of teen girl drama (<em>gossip<\/em>, emotions, crushes, confessions, drawings in diaries).\u201d What\u2019s up with this recurrence of \u201cgossip\u201d in the lexicon of decidedly post-adolescent art bros? The word retains an ambivalently feminised libidinal frisson. They want in? But it also has somewhat pejorative connotations. As you mentioned, gossip often isn\u2019t seen as erudite or intellectually serious. They want out? Maybe I\u2019m projecting. The <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/ngrams\/graph?year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=26&amp;smoothing=7&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;content=gossip&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cgossip%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bgossip%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BGossip%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BGOSSIP%3B%2Cc0#t4%3B%2Cgossip%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bgossip%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BGossip%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BGOSSIP%3B%2Cc0\">Google ngram<\/a> shows that \u201cgossip\u201d had a moment in the bitchy mid-19th century, then a dip, then a meteoric rise in use from the year 2000. Is it time to flatten the curve? Gossip is always enticing, though, and I\u2019m theoretically pro the destabilisation of gendered epistemological hierarchies\u2026 so I guess what I\u2019m saying is that, despite it all, I\u2019m interested in \u201cthe juice.\u201d Would you say that you have it, Audrey?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;Well, as Dave writes of me in those interviews, \u201cher opinion counts, but is she always a reliable source?\u201d This idea of having to be a \u201creliable source\u201d is sort of the antithesis of gossip, no? I should have something serious, researched, reliable to say but the inference is that I don\u2019t \u2014 all I have to offer is \u201copinion\u201d and the triviality of unfounded gossip. On the other hand, a source of what? Perhaps I\u2019m not even a reliable source of gossip \u2014 propagating trivialities that are so dubious no one should believe or repeat them. So I do and do not have the juice. I am the fantasy of juice lol. Therapist, mother, policewoman, gossip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As to whether I am a Blair or a Serena, I think we\u2019re all encouraged to relate to Jenny because&nbsp;<em>Gossip Girl&nbsp;<\/em>came out after what I call the self-reflexive teen comedy golden era (imo between 1999-2004). Films like&nbsp;<em>Never Been Kissed&nbsp;<\/em>and&nbsp;<em>10 Things I Hate About You&nbsp;<\/em>in 1999 through to the grand finale of&nbsp;<em>Mean Girls<\/em>&nbsp;in 2004 were all laced with a kind of&nbsp;<em>Scary Movie<\/em>&nbsp;self-parody excess, which was only possible because of the over saturation of coming-of-age films in the 80s. Riffing off&nbsp;<em>Sweet Valley High<\/em>, the popular girls all look the same and so the quirked up snowflake nerds end up being the protagonists (is this where it all started??). They fostered nerd individualism more than&nbsp;<em>Breakfast Club\/Fast Times<\/em>&nbsp;ever could. Like Jenny Humphrey, perhaps I aspire to be a bit of a Blair but I\u2019m not rich or popular enough. Although if I have to be an authority figure, I would much prefer to be Chuck Bass \u2014 the horny go-to guy when something naughty needs to be said or done. On a good day, on pay day, I\u2019m Chuck Bass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I can tell you from experience, everyone loves a villain.&#8221; \u2014 Chuck Bass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH:<\/strong>&nbsp;I\u2019d put in a Jenny quote but they\u2019re all incredibly boring. Upon reflection, she really only functions as a cautionary Icarus in fishnets. I\u2019ve changed my mind. I want the other Humphrey. I\u2019d trade it all for a New Yorker byline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;Maybe you can write my scandalous biography once I\u2019ve coughed up my best and most salacious content. As Chuck Bass says, \u201cpeople like me don&#8217;t write books, they&#8217;re written about.&#8221; But in all seriousness, we can probably agree we are none of these characters, right? They&nbsp;<em>remain<\/em>&nbsp;obscenely aspirational. In much the same way there is something that sets our grotty artists aside from artists like New York-based Bunny Rogers, who clearly investigates the cultural archetype of the Young Girl too. Instead of soiled mattresses and bed sheets, in Rogers\u2019 work we see slick avatars and objects that don\u2019t really comply with your grotty girl definition. They\u2019re too clean\/polished\/inhuman. In 2013 there was an exhibition called&nbsp;<em>Lonely Girl&nbsp;<\/em>curated by Asher Penn at New York\u2019s Martos Gallery that grouped seven female artists under thirty (including Bunny) not unlike Guzzler\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Recent Tendencies<\/em>. Except where Guzzler seemed to (however ironically) group women together by virtue of their grot-girl aesthetic and gender identity, the&nbsp;<em>Lonely Girl<\/em>&nbsp;press release read: \u201cThe artists in this show represent an unprecedented moment in cultural history \u2014 where the artists themselves can be equally or sometimes more visible than their artworks themselves.\u201d Here I think we get to the crux of the issue, not only in the sense that it is about women being subject to more scrutiny than men based on their public persona\/appearance, but we also see a grimy distinction. The Bunny Rogers, Amalia Ulman ilk are essentially Big Apple socialites \u2014 micro-celebrities \u2014 and here in lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Melbourne, we are certainly not as <em>seen<\/em>&nbsp;nor as desirable. Guzzler is, after all, a dirt-floor garage in the outer-suburbs run by two social pariahs pushing 40. Isn\u2019t that more abject in and of itself? Being abject is basically to fail as a subject\/object of desire and consumption. This is something that Bunny and Amalia essentially succeed in enacting, but it\u2019s a positionality that seems much less accessible to \u201cour\u201d Abject It Girls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In being non-celebrities, are Australian artists the last remaining artists that can lay claim to a \u201cbohemian,\u201d outsider status? Maybe this is why we see the grot and grime bubble to the surface most pungently here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2021\/01\/15050934\/mg_3906-1620x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1916\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">Alex Vivian, [detail] <em>Boom!<\/em>, 2020 at Guzzler, Melbourne.

But nor do I think it\u2019s entirely true of the whole of Australia. Even though Australia is geographically distant from the supposed cultural epicentres of the US and Europe, the flow of the internet along the lines of capital and colonialism mean that we are arguably all tuned in to the same platforms and content. And Australians also have access to a certain level of basic material stability (albeit steadily eroding), which has facilitated global mobility, visibility and \u201cbohemianism\u201d throughout the 20th century to now. Melbourne seems like a site of second or third tier cosmopolitanism (although now more distant from the action than ever as we\u2019re locked down on the continent). To me, places like Namibia or like, Uzbekistan seem truly provincial, both on the planes of online life and in terms of potential mobility to the \u201cimportant\u201d locations. But in relation to art world hierarchies, is that just completely naive? Does only New York matter, still?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the blurring of social media personae and exhibited work: I think it\u2019s both interesting and not. Scrolling through, for example, Adamo\u2019s Instagram was a cool archival insight into her practice. But I appreciated her work without it and a lot of artists I like seem to be pretty bad at performing a successful online persona. Artists that achieve some degree of transnational visibility online through relentlessly performing their image also seem to attract pathological derision (e.g., Minna Gilligan). Is this a digital micro-celeb extension of Australian cultural cringe? Maybe.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS:<\/strong>&nbsp;It\u2019s much more socially acceptable to toot your own horn in America than it is in Australia. Besides that little proviso, we regrettably share a lot of cultural values with America that stem from colonialism and the Dream of upward mobility. But we also lack US and euro visibility \u2014 Melbourne in particular lacks presence in international biennales and the global art scene more generally (outside of Melbourne\u2019s home away from home,&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/sandy-brown.com\/artists.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sandy Brown<\/a>). We might not be Namibia or Uzbekistan but we are not the \u201cLeaders of the Free World\u201d either. And where is China in this equation? Online life is defined in China by an entirely different set of code, interfaces and content but they are nonetheless&nbsp;<em>online.&nbsp;<\/em>While they have the most comprehensive and sophisticated tech, internet censorship policies and algorithms in the world at the present, the West are trying their best to catch up. \u201cAccess\u201d here starts to become a more slippery term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of an internet connection, at 68th on the Speedtest Global Index, even Australia\u2019s internet speed is well below the global average \u2014 slower than India, Kazakhstan or Latvia. Even so, the internet isn\u2019t democratising for those that do have \u201caccess\u201d (however slow). It\u2019s a very techno-utopian view that the internet obliterates old hierarchies with its decentralised structure and free information sharing etc. Algorithms and censorship aside, as I said in my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/memoreview.net\/blog\/lost-in-the-feed-translation-by-audrey-schmidt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pandemic art review<\/a>, artists have been able to upload and promote their work since the inception of the internet, but to reach broader audiences they must be associated with a brand (e.g., influencer status) or an institution that can verify their legitimacy and ideally remunerate them. So, like, I still think there is an inside and an outside, even if it\u2019s a bit of a moebius strip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, I think New York is dead because artists without trust funds or sugar daddies can\u2019t afford to live there anymore. And yes, bohemianism proper requires a certain level of financial stability for more than the elite few. This was the basis of the so-called counterculture of the 1960s \u2014 where in large parts of the Western world, scarcity was reduced so that the newly emergent bohemian class didn\u2019t have to work as much and could determine their own time. So maybe Australians have the perfect conditions for countercultural bohemianism? Or, without the political optimism of the 60s, are the floating signifiers of counterculturalism and Daiso detritus all that remains in what feels more like \u201clate&nbsp;<em>anti<\/em>-capitalism\u201d <cite>coined by Vincent Le<\/cite> than the hotly contested descriptor \u201clate capitalism\u201d?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CH:<\/strong>&nbsp;Cities with strong Wi-Fi connections and English as the primary language aren\u2019t that outsider in a&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/mitpress.mit.edu\/books\/stack\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cplanetary scale Stack.\u201d<\/a>&nbsp;Imo and to conclude, techno-utopianism should have a comeback and we need to talk about China. The early \u201ccyber\u201d theorists got a lot of stuff wrong, but they were also inspirationally committed to tech literacy\/DIY and devoted to eroding the primacy of the West (albeit often in feverish neo-Orientalist prose stylings \u2014 Sadie Plant, I love you, but yikes). The internet will never obliterate old hierarchies, but old hierarchies are in the process of being obliterated and the internet will follow. The US is in immolating decline.

The subtitle, \u201cBetween History and Literature\u201d pretty much describes his method; he\u2019s not interested in collapsing the two terms, history and literature, into one \u2014 literary history \u2014 but in using literature to get to history. His contention is that the best way to do this is not through content but through form.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, it\u2019s an unlikely wager. If you want to know about Mancunian industry in the 19th century, wouldn\u2019t you read, say, <em>North and South<\/em> for its depictions of boss-worker conflict before you read it for its sentence structure? Moretti would disagree. Literary form, he argues, gives shape to history: it is \u201cthe fossil remains of what had once been a living and problematic present.\u201d<cite>Franco Moretti, <em>The Bourgeois: Between History and Literature<\/em>&nbsp;(Verso: 2014), 14.<\/cite> You write a sentence, or a paragraph, or a book and the form\/s you write in freeze-frame the dynamics of a historical moment. This happens in spite of your skill or lack thereof in rendering it and regardless of whether or not you wrote your sentence\/paragraph\/book in service of this end \u2014 it happens in unconscious collaboration with your time and place. Crucially, form does not preserve history directly, a wormhole from Melbourne to Manchester 1834, but, if writing is an attempt to create form from messy reality, what form does do is offer a provisional resolution. So, says Moretti, you take the resolution and work backwards, scratching through to the contradictory, inchoate forces that occasioned it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An example might help here. In <em>The Bourgeois<\/em>, as in his other works, Moretti combines \u201cdistant reading\u201d (his term for the computational analysis of texts) with close reading, using data-sets of hundreds or thousands of books to aid in microscopic analysis. This affords him both precision and a bird\u2019s-eye view. He can tell you with some accuracy that <em>Robinson Crusoe<\/em>, Daniel Defoe\u2019s 1719 novel in which a young Englishman is shipwrecked on a deserted island and survives there for 28 years, uses the past-gerund approximately 9.3 times per 10,000 words. This is a rare verb form that introduces an action that has already taken place, e.g.: \u201cHaving secured my boat\u2026\u201d, \u201cHaving fitted my mast\u2026\u201d. Furthermore, Moretti can tell you that Defoe\u2019s favourite sentence structure is one in which the past-gerund combines with the past-tense action verb (what it sounds like: a verb that indicates action, in the past tense) and the infinitive verb (a verb with the word \u201cto\u201d in front of it) to create a tripartite structure that runs like so: \u201cand having stowed [past gerund] my boat very safe, I went [action verb\/past tense] on shore to look [infinitive] about me.\u201d<cite>Moretti, <em>The Bourgeois<\/em>, 51-58.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robinson cannot stop doing chores and everything about Defoe\u2019s grammar inflects the text with his busyness. The past gerund indicates a completed activity, which is only ever the basis for further action (\u201cI went on shore\u201d), which is then recruited by the infinitive \u201cto look,\u201d which suggests undefined future activity. For Moretti, this structure traces the temporal drive of capitalism \u2014 the forward march of progress through past, present, future, in that order, on repeat. In Moretti\u2019s hands, <em>Robinson Crusoe<\/em> is less an adventure novel than an imprint in prose of a burgeoning Protestant work ethic: the \u201cforever renewed\u201d cycle of capitalist accumulation and production.<cite>Max Weber quoted in Moretti, <em>The Bourgeois<\/em>, 56.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While reading Moretti, I also read <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em>, Anna Wiener\u2019s memoir of working in Silicon Valley, published this time last year, January 2020. The book follows a then-25-year old Anna as she quits her no-future publishing job in New York City for a book app startup, also in NYC. This is her first taste of start-up culture from the inside and although she is softly fired after a few months (\u201cI had trouble strategizing at scale,\u201d she remarks wryly), she then moves to San Francisco to work at an analytics startup in Silicon Valley. The bulk of the memoir chronicles her time living and working in the Valley, first at the startup (which remains unnamed throughout), and then at GitHub (also unnamed but easy to guess). At the book\u2019s close, she moves back to NYC. Outside the book\u2019s frame is her transition from occasional contributor to literary magazines like<em> n+1<\/em>, where <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em> had its genesis in her <a href=\"https:\/\/nplusonemag.com\/issue-25\/on-the-fringe\/uncanny-valley\/\">popular essay<\/a> of the same name \u2014 whose title was itself ripped from Masahiro Mori\u2019s original 1970 <a href=\"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6213238\">essay<\/a> on robotics \u2014 to debut author and contributing writer at <em>The New Yorker<\/em>. A neat arc: from writing to tech and back to writing again, failing upwards each time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Moretti and Wiener\u2019s books are about capitalism, data and labour, and both come from honorary Californians working across tech and literature. Aside from these surface similarities, they couldn\u2019t be more different, not least of all in quality. One is a deft, incidentally gorgeous, incisive critical text and the other, Wiener\u2019s, is \u2014 to be frank \u2014 a <em>New York Times<\/em>-baiting work of desperate-to-be-literary nonfiction: striving, overwrought and underwhelming. What\u2019s interesting about <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em> is not what it tells you about Silicon Valley, most of which you probably already know (key words will do it: misogyny, racism, classism, surveillance, overwork, gentrification, libertarians), but the ways in which the book tells on itself through its formal execution. Reading Moretti and reading <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em> I realised that the latter is a perfect example of the former\u2019s thesis: when attempting to understand a particular time and place through literature, content matters less than form. In <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em> what obtrudes and what rankles is form.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The most egregious formal conceit in <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em> is Wiener\u2019s use of lists. If you haven\u2019t read the book, it\u2019s hard to understand just how frequently this occurs, but I\u2019ll tell you now that a quarter of the way through I began asterisk-ing every section in which pithy, closely-observed images are cast in a series of rhythmically-homogenous sentences and stopped after another thirty pages when I realised there was no end in sight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On page 37:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Across the world, people were squeezing out the last of strangers\u2019 toothpaste, picking up strangers\u2019 soap in the shower, wiping their noses on strangers\u2019 pillowcases.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On page 39:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The cofounders had prioritized aesthetics and hired two graphic designers off the bat: men with signature hairstyles and large followings on a social network for people who referred to themselves as creatives.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On page 40:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>They were weirder, wilder, funnier, harder to keep up with. They wore Australian work boots and flannel and durable, recycled polyester athletic vests, drank energy shots in the late afternoon and popped vitamin D in the mornings \u2026 They chewed powdered Swedish tobacco &#8230; They had gone to top-tier private colleges.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On page 49:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>People courted the sublime on trail runs and day hikes, glamped in Marin and rented chalets in Tahoe.

We tried to distinguish between a political act and a political view; between praise of violent people and praise of violence; between commentary and intention.

We made mistakes.<\/p><cite>Anna Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>&nbsp;(4th Estate: 2020), 210.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to abstractions like \u201cthe platform\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The platforms, designed to accommodate and harvest infinite data, inspired an infinite scroll. They encouraged a cultural impulse to fill all spare time with someone else\u2019s thoughts. The internet was a collective howl, an outlet for everyone to prove that they mattered. The full spectrum of human emotion infused social platforms. Grief, joy, anxiety, mundanity flowed. People were saying nothing, and saying it all the time. Strangers swapped confidences with other strangers in return for unaccredited psychological advice. They shared stories of private infidelities and public incontinence; photos of their bedroom interiors; photos, faded and cherished, of long-dead family members; photos of their miscarriages. People were giving themselves away at every opportunity.<\/p><cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 187.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are at least two things going on here. First, as Jason Kehe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/book-review-uncanny-valley-anna-wiener\/\">writes<\/a>, Wiener\u2019s prose is \u201cruled by appearances, by looking and seeing.\u201d <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em> bears out with bloody-minded literalness the ubiquitous creative writing advice to \u201cshow not tell\u201d and demonstrates its shortcomings, not just for the writing itself but as a tool for political or social critique. When Wiener is at a bar, she observes a few women waiting in the toilet queue:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>They looked around my age, but polished \u2014 shinier. They looked like the sort of woman I had wanted, and failed, to become back in publishing; self-possessed, socially graceful, manicured. They were probably having a different kind of night.&nbsp;<\/p><cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 62.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The observation leads to the inference \u2014 they looked a certain way, so \u201cthey were probably\u201d <em>x<\/em>. That Wiener infers this from the women\u2019s appearances is fine, normal, who doesn\u2019t do this? It becomes a problem when appearance stands in for sustained or varied methods of inquiry, which it does for most of the book, or when applied to weightier matters. Wiener might have included a history of Silicon Valley, or dug into the long history of women in computing, or she might have used her observations to put forward an argument (instead, she makes a virtue of her ambivalence \u2014 more on this later). She doesn\u2019t do any of these things, just watches and records. Then again, perhaps she uses this form on repeat precisely <em>because<\/em> it\u2019s a weak method; it yields little insight each time so she has to do it a lot. Can sheer volume add up to utility? Unfortunately, she\u2019s also contending with an incompatibility between aesthetic and political critique. If you want to buy a million dollar apartment in San Fran and you\u2019ve saved up $999,000 in Monopoly money, you still won\u2019t be close to landing the property.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, someone, some time during the production of this text, decided that this book would be the ur-text of its time and place, a generation-defining memoir (\u201cJoan Didion at a startup\u201d claims Rebecca Solnit on the front cover). To achieve this, Wiener has to be both timely and timeless. The reams of SF-tech-specific observation are obviously intended to capture 2010s SF tech in all its idiosyncrasy. That the objects described are stripped of brand names and proper nouns and instead couched in generic terms (\u201cAustralian work boots\u201d instead of R.Ms) is an attempt to tip the scales back towards timelessness. One thing Wiener does well with these generic substitutions is convey the newly-generic nature of San Fran under tech\u2019s gentrifying hold.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably it\u2019s the aim of any self-styled literary writer to strike the timely\/timeless balance, but this has repercussions for Wiener\u2019s prose. I\u2019ll return to this thought in a moment. First, a detour by way of the other most striking feature of Wiener\u2019s writing, something most of her reviewers have noted, if not detailed: its baked-in ambivalence. At every step, she qualifies her excitement with vague discontents. When her analytics startup releases a new feature for app developers called <em>Addiction<\/em>, which quantifies users\u2019 engagement with their product, she enjoys its slick execution but pauses on its bad-taste name and ethics: \u201cThe novelty of Addiction was exciting, but the premise made me uneasy.\u201d<cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 141.<\/cite> On Reddit: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for me, but I read it anyway.\u201d<cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 172.<\/cite> On seeing young women programmers at a conference: \u201cI wished, vaguely, that I had stuck with the programming exercises the previous year.\u201d<cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 177.<\/cite> As the memoir progresses, Wiener grows more disillusioned, more burnt out. On seeing a friend\u2019s performance back in New York City: \u201cI did not want to be an ingrate, but I had trouble seeing why writing support emails for a venture-funded startup should offer more economic stability than creative work or civic contributions.\u201d<cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 195.<\/cite> But even from the start she\u2019s uncertain: \u201cI had trouble admitting to my social group that I was moving across the country solely to work at a startup.\u201d<cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 34.<\/cite> Instead of a gradual coming-to-consciousness \u2014 reaching an ethical nadir and getting out \u2014 there\u2019s a half-consciousness there the whole time, tugging her and her sentences in two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s possible that Wiener views this endless hedging as a way to cop to her privilege or explore the complexity of her position, but stalling in contradiction is not the same thing as nuance, I realised while reading this book, not the same as \u201cstaying with the trouble,\u201d to quote yet another techy Californian straddling the worlds of science and art. Moretti, for his part, is proof that you can write and read from a place of complicity and do it beautifully, using the tools of surveillance and data-collection to produce forceful, subtle critiques of the very economic regime that produced these tools in the first place. (\u201cCome on,\u201d Anna\u2019s ex-colleague tells her over a drink, \u201cWe worked at a surveillance company.\u201d)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in<em> Uncanny Valley<\/em>, ambivalence becomes a conservative gesture \u2014 conservative here in the sense of preserving things as they are, ensuring that nothing much changes. Her hyper-observational prose and her hedging are both symptoms of this. The way she introduces and dispatches the possibility of a union for tech workers and a socialist reckoning for Silicon Valley in three pages is another, as is the obligatory 2016-election-crisis-of-conscience morality play of the final chapter. But, pace Moretti, I want to show you how this conservatism manifests in form. <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em>, the book, is written in the past tense, while \u201cUncanny Valley\u201d the essay is in the present. Compare this, from the essay:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The annual-review cycle is nigh, and I\u2019m on the fence about whether or not to bring up the running list of casual hostilities toward women that add unsolicited spice to the workplace.<\/p><cite>Anna Wiener, &#8220;Uncanny Valley&#8221; in&nbsp;<em>n+1<\/em>, Spring 2016, no. 25. Accessed from <a href=\"https:\/\/nplusonemag.com\/issue-25\/on-the-fringe\/uncanny-valley\/\">https:\/\/nplusonemag.com\/issue-25\/on-the-fringe\/uncanny-valley\/<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To this, from the book:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>As my annual review rolled around, I found myself on the fence about whether or not to bring up the running list of casual hostilities toward women that added unsolicited texture to the workplace.<\/p><cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 138.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving aside the word choices \u2014 from the high-drama of \u201cnigh\u201d to the bureaucratic drudgery of \u201crolled around\u201d \u2014 the tense shift gives Wiener\u2019s prose a faux-literary weightiness, written as if for a distant future (the weirdness of the past tense will be softened by the passage of time) in which she takes her place as a \u201cgeneration-defining voice,\u201d or enters university syllabi, or is lost on the dusty shelves of a second-hand book store, a curio from a dead era. This is another facet of her timely-timeless aim. In using the past tense, Wiener has one eye fixed on the future by interpolating the book as an important artefact of a past-to-come.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other effect is probably unintended. Where the present tense would put the reader in the decision-making seat with the narrator, the past tense gives the events a sense of inevitability: \u201cI\u2019m on the fence\u201d from the essay vs. \u201cI found myself on the fence\u201d from the book. This sits uneasily with the immediacy of Wiener\u2019s narration. You are held close to Wiener\u2019s point of view, in lockstep with her observations, but all of this presentness is mediated by the past tense, which gives you the impression of hindsight, the clarity time brings, without any attendant deepening of thought. The relentless, slippery, open present of Wiener\u2019s experience, held within the calcifying inevitability of the past: what better way to foreclose the possibility of things being otherwise, to knit ambivalence into the form, or \u2014 no \u2014 to pay lip-service to this ambivalence in content while the form exempts her from personal responsibility and all but ensures political stasis?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of Wiener\u2019s five years in Silicon Valley, she writes her book. The book is published and printed, enters circulation \u2014 becomes a commodity \u2014 and performs on a macro level what it does on the level of form: offers absolution to its author. It\u2019s not only that she writes her confessions and, through the process of confessing, is absolved of her sins, but that in the process of commodification, her experiences and choices are objectified, made impersonal. As literary nonfiction, even the process of commodification is forgiven and forgotten. Through form, and through slick product design and marketing, the reader is positioned to think <em>Uncanny Valley<\/em> better than mere confession, better than the latest longread, better than the pulp sold at airports, better than its source material. If you changed the form, what would remain of the content? Through form, Wiener can hide that there\u2019s little of value here \u2014 just an appearance of value, which, as Marx tells us, is precisely how commodities work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiener herself muses on the insubstantiality that underpins her life in San Fran. When she reads celebrated contemporary literature, she finds only \u201cgestural text, the equivalent of a rumpled linen bedsheet or a bunch of dahlias placed just so\u201d on Instagram, and thinks: \u201cOh \u2026 This author is addicted to the internet, too.\u201d<cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 189.<\/cite> The problem for Wiener is that, online, depth and context collapses: \u201cEverything was simultaneously happening in real time and preserved for posterity, in perpetuity.\u201d<cite>Wiener, <em>Uncanny Valley: A Memoir<\/em>, 187.<\/cite> This is exactly what the book\u2019s form, particularly its sentences, reveals: beneath the anxious hyper-specificity, the no-time and no-place inculcated by capitalism. In fifty years, there will be enough books of this ilk to make a data-set for distant readers of the future and Wiener\u2019s will be just one among many on the list.<\/p>\n",

It is ultimately my contention that 2020 will forever after trigger traumatic flashbacks that cannot be cancelled or deplatformed when the very structure of time itself <em>changed <\/em>\u2014 or at least mutated, accelerated and spiraled a little more out of our already dubious control in an altogether different and definitive direction. What is needed amidst all the chaos is something like a <em>mascot<\/em>, a characterisation almost cartoonish in its simplicity that could nonetheless act as the year\u2019s official spokesperson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, such a spokesperson already exists. The 2020 Summer Olympics was scheduled to be held in Tokyo before becoming another coronavirus casualty and being postponed until 2021. With all promotional and merchandising materials remaining the same, the spectre of 2020 will continue to haunt us well into the new year, including in the guise of the official Tokyo Olympics mascot named Miraitowa, a checkered indigo-blue anime character inspired by the games\u2019 logo. The mascot designed by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi emerged victorious from a mass grave of 2000 candidate designs through the Hobbesian war of all against all which was the Tokyo Organizing Committee\u2019s cutthroat competitive selection process. Along with two other shortlisted candidates, Miraitowa was then forced to jump through hoops and over hurdles to vie for the votes of over 200,000 Japanese elementary schools, with Miraitowa eventually winning over half of the final tally. Even the mascot\u2019s name, which we will have reason to return to later, is a product of the Tokyo Organizing Committee\u2019s critique of judgement no less ruthless than the games themselves. Like the animal testing research unit of some sinister and mysterious megacorporation, every adorable fibre and bone in Miraitowa\u2019s body was meticulously designed and perfected in a battle against other bright-eyed furry rivals, which were sent off to the abattoir of botched marketing ideas when they failed to elicit beaming smiles on the endearing faces of unwittingly sadistic school children. The lone survivor is now expected to help finance the games and earn an estimated 14.4 billion yen ($130 million US) in revenue from licensing merchandise, something which will prove pivotal to Japan\u2019s recovery efforts after the massive slug to its tourism guts during lockdown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therein lies one way to characterise the 2020 time slice: what writer Paul B. Preciado has called \u201cthe great mutation\u201d is essentially an evolutionary selection process for placing adaptive pressures on modes of governance, along with the various cultures, social relations, productive forces and psychological types under their jurisdiction, thereby forcing them to self-improve and mutate in the struggle for survival.<cite>Paul B. Preciado, \u201cThe Losers Conspiracy,\u201d Artforum, 26 March, 2020, accessed 29 March, 2020, https:\/\/www.artforum.com\/slant\/the-losers-conspiracy-82586.<\/cite> Where \u201csurvival,\u201d philosopher Peter Sloterdijk tells us, \u201cis a code word for nature acrobatics\u201d: \u201cExistence as such is an acrobatic achievement, and no one can say with certainty what training provides the necessary skills to master this discipline. Hence the acrobat no longer knows what exercises keep him from falling \u2014 aside from constant vigilance.\u201d<cite>Peter Sloterdijk, You Must Change Your Life: On Anthropotechnics, trans. Wieland Hoban (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2013), 118, 63.<\/cite> From international alliances and national governance to the most intimate social relations and molecular immune systems, every scale of human existence has been thrown into nature\u2019s gladiatorial octagon where they are forced to compete in the most extreme sports, trying out random variations in the hopes of reproducing themselves stronger than ever upon the ruins of 2020. At the macroscale, the personified anime version of the virus known as Coronachan has proven to be post-political, undermining as she has both sides of the traditional left-right political spectrum, with theocratic Iran and quasi-fascist Brazil suffering just as big death counts, economic hardship and hits to their legitimacy as Western liberal democracies like Italy and the US. Coronachan loves democracy just as much as she loves fascism, as anti-science has proven to be just as fruitful for the spread of the virus as the democratic rights to freedom of movement, freedom of assembly and freedom of herd mentality. This is why socialists can argue that the free market is impotent at providing for all those falling ill or thrown out of a job at the same time that nationalists are calling for border closures, localising manufacturing and supply chains, and implementing quasi-authoritarian emergency powers to flatten the curve. It turns out that the political spectrum is more like a globe: travel too far in one direction and, without even knowing it, you will wind up going around in circles like a dog chasing its own tail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the microscale, the pure and empty form of quarantime has seen the beta revolution strike back through the incelisation and enforced monogamy of human populations <em>en masse<\/em> as individuals self-isolate and keep their distance by implementing ruthless selection criteria for deciding which friends and loved ones are really essential in a world where every greeting could be a kiss goodbye. Having barricaded ourselves in bedroom bunkers like an increasingly impotent F\u00fchrer during the fall of Berlin, the isolation and necessity of putting all our plans on indefinite hold has led depression and suicide rates to skyrocket higher than any gold medalist high jumper, with nihilism and ancient atomism becoming official state-sanctioned policies. At what is the most open and darkest level, we have even seen a full-blown eugenics project revived whenever hospitals in the US or elsewhere find themselves overrun with the infected, forcing them to cancel elective surgeries and decide who will be treated based on their chances of survival. That is, of course, if they are not rich old white guys like Prince Charles and Donald Trump who receive the best healthcare regardless of their age or pre-existing comorbidities. Try and argue with a virus, you will just get deadly droplets on yourself. Dialectics is cancelled after curfew and there can be no more games of giving and asking for reasons once the social distancing measures take effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official character profile of Miraitowa sheds even more light on the 2020 time slice than the acrobatic selection process from whence it emerged: the mascot has \u201ca special power to instantly teleport anywhere it wants\u201d in keeping with the Tokyo Organizing Committee\u2019s belief that \u201cit\u2019s important to showcase the latest technology.\u201d<cite>Tokyo 2020, \u201cTokyo 2020 Mascot,\u201d Tokyo 2020, accessed 14 August, 2020, https:\/\/tokyo2020.org\/en\/games\/olympics-mascot\/#:~:text=The%20name%20MIRAITOWA%20is%20based,of%20everyone%20around%20the%20world.; and David Wharton, \u201cRobots Will Be Part of the 2020 Olympics Experience in Tokyo,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 22 July, 2019, accessed 14 August, 2020, https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/sports\/story\/2019-07-22\/robots-will-be-part-of-the-2020-olympics-experience-in-tokyo.<\/cite> Those brave \u2014 or stupid? \u2014 enough to attend the games in person are thus most likely to encounter Miraitowa in the form of robotic clones and automatons which can wave and shake their hands (or perhaps bump elbows) and express emotions like the beaming emoji love hearts in their eyes. Semi-autonomous robots are even expected to help collect javelins and hammers and film the games through built-in cameras.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technological innovation has been another hallmark of 2020 just as much as it will be at the Tokyo Olympics as Coronachan has accelerated the development of emerging technologies and existing trends much faster than even the masterminds behind Zoom could ever have imagined. Distant learning, telehealth services and remote work from home are all doing their bit to upload our collective consciousness to mind-computer interfaces with most of our lives now taking place online through computers which have undergone rapid improvements to cater to increased demand and proliferating use values. As their meatspace competitors are closed down as non-essential businesses, it is streaming services like Netflix, transportation and delivery apps like Uber and online marketplaces like Amazon that have proven to be the biggest beneficiaries. It is hardly surprising that one of the most common tin-hatted conspiracy theories trending today is that the virus is just a scapegoat for the harmful effects caused by 5G technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Short of becoming full-blown biotechnologically enhanced cyborgs with superhuman prosthetic body mods, the only thing that can now wander the streets with impunity are drones and other autonomous robots. No wonder they are being ramped up for use in the production and distribution of goods and services like delivery, surveillance and disinfecting uninhabitable hot zones beyond the bounds of possible human experience. The need to minimise physical contact with others is also behind a further push for the digitisation of money through contactless payments and cryptocurrencies, with drug dealers now standing as the unlikely last line of defense for the cash economy. If we dare to venture outside, we will find ourselves constantly surveilled like never before by cameras, drones, temperature detectors and even our own smartphones\u2019 location data through contact tracing apps and QR codes. All of this is just to say that 2020 has brought about an unprecedented acceleration of both emerging technologies and existing tendencies\u2014from mind-computer interfaces as we isolate ourselves in the discomfort of our makeshift panic rooms, to self-organising machines that alone roam the deserted streets after curfew. It\u2019s all in the name that evokes 2.0 not once but twice, as if something were being amplified or intensified\u2014and then some!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The name Miraitowa is a compound of the Japanese words \u201cmira\u201d meaning future (\u672a\u6765) and \u201ctowa\u201d (\u6c38\u4e45) meaning eternity, which is meant to represent without any irony \u201cthe wish that the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games will lead to a future of everlasting hope in the hearts of everyone around the world.\u201d<cite>Tokyo 2020, \u201cTokyo 2020 Mascot.\u201d<\/cite> While it now seems unlikely that 2020 will trigger anything but universal despair, the year has been in keeping with the idea that Miraitowa\u2019s name marks \u201ca tribute to both the respected tradition and modern innovation of Japanese culture,\u201d recalling the age-old proverb to \u201clearn from the past and develop new ideas.\u201d<cite>Tokyo 2020, \u201cTokyo 2020 Mascot.\u201d<\/cite> In more ways than one, the 2020 time slice marks the violent collision of both the future and eternity, of the progressive, linear sense of time based on the line and the ancient, cyclic calendar revolving around the circle into an anomalous hybrid beholden to something more like a spiral. As per the calendrical systems of the ancient East based on recurring seasonal harvests, the circle is a monotonous movement of pure repetition. As per the Western enlightenment belief in historical progress, the line moves to the rhythm of a linear succession towards some final goal or all-encompassing telos. The spiral steals a little from each while subverting both. It partakes in the monotonous harvest motions of the circle, but it does so only to generate novel phase shifts like the line. Spiral time is thus akin to the mad philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine of the eternal return, not exactly of the same, but of the eternal present as it undermines our far-off, fairytale ideals and teleological dreams through its ceaseless becoming in much the same way that the second, third and nth waves of quarantime subvert, or at least postpone, all our plans and ambitions for the foreseeable future. It is only fitting that the Olympic symbol of the spiral of five interlocking rings is branded front and center on Miraitowa\u2019s forehead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a ceremony at the modern Tokyo Midtown Hibiya, Miraitowa made full use of its teleporting ability by miraculously appearing (through people dressed in identical costumes) at the ancient Asakusa temple in the center of old Tokyo. By simultaneously popping up in different places and times from Japan\u2019s traditional past and hyper-modern future, Miraitowa evoked a sense of future shock, of the many different revolutions and phase shifts that have come and gone over the course of the country\u2019s rollercoaster history ride. Far from betraying a hopeless Proustian lover boy\u2019s nostalgic search for lost time, Miraitowa actually affirmed the future by disorientating onlookers with the sense of constant change and ever-increasing complexity over the archeological ruins of time. If Miraitowa is the perfect mascot for 2020, it is because the year marks precisely the moment when time definitively spirals out of our control as it travels back to the past, if only to create something unprecedented from the angel of history\u2019s ashes. By now, it is a platitude to point out that Coronachan marks a rerun of past pandemics that have always heralded historical events of seismic upheaval, from the black plague that ushered in the Renaissance and the European colonisation of the Americas whose original weapon of mass destruction was smallpox, to the Spanish influenza on the infected tailcoats of the first world war. Although 2020 did see us time travelling to the past, it was precisely to those moments of great mutation where history reaped its revenge. And, as Sloterdijk warned us in theory before Coronachan punishingly showed us in practice, \u201call history is the history of immune system battles.\u201d<cite>Sloterdijk, You Must Change Your Life, 451.<\/cite> It is the same thing that those on the left who say \u2014 in admittedly ever fewer numbers and ever softer lamentations \u2014 that 2020 marks yet another terminal crisis for capitalism fail to realise: eternally recurring crises are capitalism\u2019s fundamental machine part by means of which it has always adapted and reinvented itself anew through an incessant process of creative destruction. The death knell of capitalism is only ever a relatively peaceful calm before the Poseidon\u2019s storm of new money Gatsbyians who \u201ckeep the capitalist engine in motion\u201d through \u201cthe new consumers\u2019 goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organisation that capitalist enterprise creates.\u201d<cite>Joseph A. Schumpeter, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (London: Routledge, 2003), 83.<\/cite> As Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter continues, this is \u201cthe same process of industrial mutation\u2014if I may use that biological term\u2014that incessantly revolutionises the economic structure <em>from within<\/em>, incessantly destroying the old, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism.\u201d<cite>Schumpeter, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, 83.<\/cite> It is not Mao but capitalism, or Mao <em>as<\/em> <em>a capitalist<\/em>, who can say with any sincerity \u201cthere is chaos under heaven; the situation is excellent.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Olympic Games are no less exemplary of the spiral of time inasmuch as they puncture history every four years with a series of sporting events in which thousands of athletes from around the world push their bodies and minds to their inhuman limits to prove themselves the best of the best\u2014what Sloterdijk has called \u201cthe most comprehensive organisational form for human behaviour of effort and practice that could always be observed outside the worlds of work and war.\u201d<cite>Sloterdijk, You Must Change Your Life,\u201d 83.<\/cite> Through the opening and closing ceremonies, each host city of the games is just as competitive as the athletes themselves as they seek to showcase their world-historical importance by beating their predecessors in memorability through evermore expensive and complex displays of singing, theatre, dancing, music, culture and technological prowess. While the modern Olympics might seem like an exercise in neoclassical nostalgia for the ancient Greek tradition, what is really being repeated is the <em>recursive self-improvement<\/em> of the athletes and host cities as they take ever higher leaps towards Mount Olympus every time. Although these adrenaline junkies\u2019 various endgames of winning by <em>x <\/em>points in <em>y<\/em> rounds or seconds are relatively arbitrary, the universal means of mental discipline, physical endurance and all-around self-cultivation are anything but.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official Olympic creed could not have summed up better the way that whatever goals they think they are pursuing are actually just an excuse to unleash the means of realising those goals and the self-transformations they entail when taken to the utmost extreme: \u201cThe most important thing in the Olympic games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.\u201d<cite>The International Olympic Committee, \u201cThe Olympic Motto,\u201d Olympic Games, accessed 14 August, 2020,  https:\/\/www.olympic.org\/the-olympic-motto.<\/cite> Or, as the official Olympic motto puts it even more memorably, \u201c<em>citius, altius, fortius<\/em>,\u201d meaning <em>faster, higher, stronger<\/em>.<cite>The International Olympic Committee, \u201cThe Olympic Motto.\u201d<\/cite> Every four years, the games alert us to the fact that time is not so much hurtling towards the fulfilment of our desires and dreams in the static fullness of being as much as it wraps us around an incessant and restless becoming which no virginal angel of history or beta world spirit could ever control and subordinate to its own narrow-minded ends. It is all too fitting that the only years the Olympics have been cancelled were 1916, 1940 and 1944 when the world was competing in a not altogether different, if much more bloody armed conflict, as well as 2020 when every city on earth was already too busy displaying spectacular feats of nature acrobatics. Even though the games didn\u2019t take place, 2020 was no less Herculean, and indeed more so than any other Olympic year to date inasmuch as the four-year timespan was halved into a consecutive two-year condensation; first as a planetary pandemic, then as a more traditional sporting event. With drones, robots and autonomous machines set to be on full display at the Tokyo Olympics as much as they are during quarantime, it would seem as if the future is getting so much faster, higher and stronger as to jump beyond the human altogether and into the mountain clouds where the gods themselves reside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By now our terror management mechanisms might be working overtime by objecting that Miraitowa is just an innocuous marketing gimmick without any further significance. But as natural selection and the Invisible Hand taught puppies and advertising executives long ago, Miraitowa\u2019s cuddly <em>kawaii<\/em> aesthetic might just be the tactical means to camouflage its true intentions and deceive us into letting down our guard until the time is right to strike. This is something that we are only just beginning to learn as we come to don masks whenever we wander outside to survive the pandemics and bushfires as a dying Gaia coughs out its last breath. It is easy to forget that Miraitowa\u2019s cuteness was bred through a selection process no less nasty, brutish and short than what gave rise to kittens and puppies insofar as it is a means of rebooting Japan\u2019s economy so that it can compete once more in the world market, particularly through its robotics and AI industries. If such machines are to ever spiral out of our control, it won\u2019t be as terrifying Terminators with gatling guns for arms, but as deceptively endearing big-eyed anime girls like Alita Battle Angel. It will thus be all the more disquieting to see adorable Miraitowa automatons throwing javelins, wielding hammers and spying on crowds through built-in cameras at the 2020 Summer Olympics. When all is said and done, Miraitowa is far more monstrous than any Lovecraftian shoggoth or cthulic abomination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In masking our future eternity as an entertaining fiction in the present until the trumpets of judgment day are ready to blast, Miraitowa is like the many movies about killer plagues and runaway viruses which have seen a resurgence in popularity due to their uncanny anticipations of the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, the 1988 anime film <em>Akira <\/em>stands out for a single scene depicting a billboard counting down 147 days until the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with \u201cjust cancel it!\u201d graffitied over it. If such ominous fictions as <em>Akira<\/em> and Miraitowa tell us anything, it is that 2020 is the year when natural and commercial evolution, technological acceleration and even time itself finally made us realise that the human race is being cancelled in favor of something more acrobatic, more competitive and Olympian \u2014 in sum, something more like a <em>god<\/em>. Happy new year! Welcome to our future eternity! Faster, higher, stronger! Leave your other resolutions in the past. You never did keep to them anyway. Where we\u2019re going, you won\u2019t need them anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/12\/27232829\/2019-07-22-Robots-thumbnail-1908x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1836\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n",

Flanked by large headlands on the east and the west, two lifeguards sat on their tower chairs beside each other, staring ahead in silence. James had been fifteen minutes late this morning, so Sandra dragged the flags and the rescue boards out from the shed alone. She had a statuesque swimmer\u2019s body.&nbsp; She wore a red one-piece swimsuit and he wore matching little red shorts.&nbsp; It was just the two of them this early in the day. He still smelt vaguely of Clara from the night before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Hey mate, I\u2019m going for a dip&#8221; He said at 6.30 am, and ran down into the water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra shifted in her seat watching James do backstroke in the crashing waves. He was a stronger swimmer than her by far, but she could beat him hands down in a beach sprint. Most mornings lately she would have to set up alone like this. Clara and James started seeing each other after the Formal a few months ago and since then have been hooking up every other night. So he would arrive at 6.15, silent,&nbsp; letting the wind throw cheap perfume in her face. He\u2019d then swim for 10 minutes to wash off the night before. They\u2019d worked together for nearly four years but it was only recently that he hadn\u2019t been pulling his weight. Back then they would have chatted for hours about school, their parents, friends and <em>Home &amp; Away<\/em>. These days he texts Clara most of the time and she allowed her mind to drift out into the ocean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra didn\u2019t mind the new quiet. She used the time to observe the tides and try to predict their patterns. She would read them like words, or like friends, or like words with friends, or like a super-complex system, or like someone\u2019s pockets full of money. James had discovered Clara, so Sandra discovered the tides. She became infatuated by them. Each morning she would greet them before he arrived. Legs spread up on the tower alone. She would say out loud, in a good strong voice \u2014&nbsp;<em>Hello, good to get to know you today. I know you not as you were yesterday, nor will I know you as the same tomorrow.&nbsp;<\/em>She would feel the ocean rumble in approval. She\u2019d<em>&nbsp;<\/em>then count the waves, gauge their strength and hierarchy. She\u2019d twist her mind through them, do backflips through the sets in meditation.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>It would often speak back to her and offer wonderful gifts. About a month ago she had been in a deep connection with a particularly strong current for a good two hours. Later that evening, she walked along the shore and a perfectly round stone washed up in front of her. It was as black as obsidian so she kept it as a makeshift yoni egg. Pulse Pulse Pulse. Hold. Breathe. Drum. Drum. Drop. Repeat. Pulse Pulse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a small lifeguard shed not far from the tower, up closer towards the parking lot and milk bar and the freeway. Wind would shutter through rafters to make them creak and bend. A rodent scuttled through, stopping at a forgotten paddle boat from the 70s. On the walls there were racks of dusty ores and flotation rings gathering cobwebs. The mouse wandered around quietly, taking morning inventory of her realm \u2014 counting all the boats and oars.&nbsp; The threshold of her space was marked by a great wooden door secured by a rusty padlock. The mouse scuttled to her door and peeked out to see a well-built man in red shorts sitting in the in the sun. She took extra cover beneath a dry leaf, only her little nose and whiskers poking out. His body was so strong and damp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHey babe\u2026 yep\u2026 yeah\u2026 nah\u2026 she\u2019s being weird again.\u201d He said, holding his phone with a towel around his hand to stop it from getting wet. The little mouse watched him walk in circles now, sniffing at his salty body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you later babe.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLunch?\u201d Sandra asked at 1 o\u2019clock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChicken Pie.\u201d He said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDrink?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSprite. Thanks mate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra walked up to the Milk Bar and fished out their lunch from a freezer bin. She placed the two pies in the small microwave and set the timer to five minutes. The small light showed them slowly defrost and go soggy. The thin plastic packaging curled in the heat waves, collecting condensation from the pastry as they spun in little circles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBusy down there today?\u201d Asked the thin store clerk, leaning over his small counter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNup.\u201d She said, not looking away from her little universe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timer dinged and two soggy pastries emerged. She stuffed them into white paper bags and bought them to the counter with 1 x Sprite and 1 x black instant coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe weather\u2019s due to turn at 12 so let\u2019s hope that will get some little tadpoles coming down!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLittle Tadpoles?\u201d She asked. He was a thin man in a fitted striped shirt. He stood in front of a large window that framed her beach. She saw the tower as a small blur in the distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, the little ones. Brandy, Cassidy, Sean, Joanna and Ruby. They come down here a lot lately.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh, right. Them.\u201d She replied, watching the small shadow of James walking up and down their beach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Milk Bar clerk was just standing there grinning. He\u2019s psychotic. His clothing fit too well. He was about 45 and had told her that he moved to Portsea for a&nbsp;<em>fresh start.<\/em>&nbsp;She thought about the abhorrent things he must\u2019ve done to atone for in this coastal milk bar. Suddenly his counter was too sterile for her. All the cleaning agents in the room became very apparent to her nose. She saw his hand cells drying from hand sanitiser, threw him a pink $5 and left.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back at the tower she watched James carefully drizzle sauce over his pie. The wind had picked up a little, so his wavy blonde hair flapped over his eyes. She looked at the hive of whiteheads that lived at the corner of his lips. He released a burp and leaned back after finishing. Sandra noticed a red welt on his stomach.&nbsp; It was like little red racetracks of different red streaks; she saw no pattern but stared at them trying to decode them regardless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUm, what are those?\u201d She asked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThose.\u201d She pointed down at the red streaks that emerged from below the elastic of his shorts. \u201cDid something bite you? There are loads of White Tails around this season.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d He asked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPortsea Ecological Foundation\u2019s Twitter.\u201d She said, looking closer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFuck off mate! They\u2019re scratch marks or something\u201d He twisted his torso to show her. \u201cSandflies or something.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNup.\u201d She said: \u201cSandflies don\u2019t concentrate bites in one area. They\u2019d get you everywhere. Show me!\u201d She reached out, grasping for his shorts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStop you perv!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m not perving. White Tail bites are serious if you don\u2019t get them checked out. Maggie got rushed to hospital last week because she was bitten on the scalp. She had no idea until she was wiggling on the ICU floor.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUrgh fine.\u201d He untied the red shorts and shimmied them down to the hilt of his pale dick, revealing a quaff of black hair. The whole area was welted where he\u2019d been scratching. She saw little dark spots on his skin like mounds. She gently agitated one with her nail and his body jolted at the touch.&nbsp; The little thing began to crawl.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOmg you have crabs.\u201d She blurted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t they moving?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes when she stared so hard into the ocean, her gaze would begin to feel dense and heavy. Under the sun, with a full stomach and the ocean\u2019s yoni egg in place, she would feel the ocean spirit tug at her like a rope tied to her tummy.&nbsp; When alone in the tower, she would let out heavy groans towards the sea, bleating like a goat. It would call back to her by sending gigantic waves, or a zig-zaggy current, or the blowhole nearby would erupt with her wailing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The morning clouds dissipated at 11:10 am and true to the Milk Bar clerk\u2019s word, a car pulled into the parking lot. About five kids<em>&nbsp;<\/em>ran down holding towels and lunch bags. Their parents waved from rolled down windows and drove back towards the freeway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOi!\u201d James yelled up at the car.&nbsp; \u201cThose fucking parents are leaving their kids again. This is not a fucking daycare!\u201d He was waving and shouting. \u201cOi! Watch your own fucking kids!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They sprinted across the hot sand. Sandra didn\u2019t really mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, there are five of them.\u201d Sandra called out while she noted down each kid\u2019s description in their log. A fundamental rule of lifeguarding was the first head count. After that you just watch. And act: Sandra took this very seriously, making sure to write the date on top of the page too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>One purple one piece bathing suit, blue goggles: 10 years old approx, green speedo with a red snorkel: 8 y\/o approx. two piece pink bikini w\/ yellow dots: 5 total: no dog or cat.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra cast her mind into the waves. She let herself drift into a soft trance. She imagined money as an animal. Then the sea as an animal. Then money as a sea or a super-complex or stupid human.&nbsp;<em>If you\u2019re just a human? Show me how you feel sorrow.&nbsp;<\/em>The blowhole exploded. She thought of herself and James as money in the water, drifting little pink $5 notes in the undercurrent. Her eyes glazed and she felt groggy like the obsidian yoni egg pulling her over. Malaise came over her in pulsing waves but she still concentrated on the water\u2019s patterns.&nbsp;<em>Examine the 2nd wave of the 4th set. That\u2019s the mode of the day. That\u2019s in the 7th set and judged by the power of the 6th wave.&nbsp;<\/em>She counted out seven waves from the first set. At the 2nd wave she saw a dark streak in the ocean like lightning, beginning right between their flags \u2014 where the kids played in the shallows. A tumultuous rip was forming before her eyes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She watched the children being swept out but couldn\u2019t move in her seat. The yoni egg kept her fastened down like a magnet. A tingling sensation began at her crown and trickled slowly down her sun kissed face. It was like the very membrane of her skin felt fizzy and prickly. She remembered a TED talk where a lady was self-aware during her own stroke. A soft voice came to her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What would you give for these children? For their lives?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you the spirit of the ocean?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I am a spirit of this part of the sea, yes, there is no spirit of the entire ocean.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it you who I speak with, where I get my knowledge of patterns? Of the sea and of money?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Will you let me kill your friend?&nbsp;<\/em>Asked the voice. She saw James over near the reef, unaware that the children were in dire need of his help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Will you let me suck him under? I want to see his body twirl in my depths.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not him, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Which man will you give?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra conjured an image of the Milk Bar clerk. The first man that came to mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thank you.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With some expert movements she expelled the yoni egg and ran down the ladder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On hearing her scream, James immediately ran for the life boards and grabbed two. He followed her sprinting into the waves, ready for any command she may throw at him. He\u2019d been a lifeguard for nearly four years now but she was far superior. Halfway out they were paddling beside each other and he saw the drive in her eyes, the waters ripple in her pupils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow many again?\u201d He yelled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201c<\/em>One purple 10 green speedo red 8 two bikini\u2026<em>&#8221; <\/em>She chanted all their descriptions. It all sounded like nonsense to him, but he trusted her. Five.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the spot where the kids went under, they stopped to gather their breath bobbing on their boards looking down into the depths for any sign. She felt the under currents sucking them deeper and deeper away from her. She told James to secure the boards together for CPR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the first dive,\u201d she said and went under.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down in the ocean where the waves above were far off, there lived a small hermit crab called Michelle. She had beady eyes like black pools and the most fabulous shell on the peninsula. Today on her walk through her shipwreck she saw some five little children, drifting down towards her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yay. She thought. What a nice surprise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe one will land right next to me. Maybe I can watch the air bubbles trickle out of its mouth. She thought of all the ways she could nibble on their skin once it became waterlogged enough to eat. She hoped that they would land near her so she could crawl over them. Oh she hoped this would happen. Oh what a blessing from the tri-goddesses of the reef, of the waves, of the shipwreck. She thanked Goriodisg\u2019skkaffa. She thanked FFslkd\u2019lldklld, she thanked YUU\u2019Ullfl. But then a darker shape approached and snatching them all up away from her. She raised her tiny pincers and nipped up at Sandra as she swam them towards the surface.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra hurled them onto the boards. They took it in turns to revive the children one by one. Eventually they were surrounded by five coughing and spluttering children. Sandra and James moved to the back of their makeshift raft and paddled it back towards the beach, side by side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d He asked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDunno.\u201d She said. \u201cJust had a feeling.\u201d There was no way James would believe her connection with their beach spirit, or whatever it was. She could feel it now though. Stronger than ever, below her, speaking with her, attached to them, she would forever be in conversation with her. Her father, her goddess, her friends, her be all and end all, her love, her guides, her limbs and heart. The goddess, her goddess was below her \u2014 touching her, caressing her legs with currents. Keeping her warm. They gathered the children under their tower to wait for the Toyota Camry to return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once it did, James and the father nearly got in a fist fight up in the parking lot. She had never seen him this angry, but the father was both ashamed and very tipsy, so Sandra separated them. The mother was crying and hugging all them in a big mound of towels. Pretty much everyone in Portsea came down to the Back Beach that afternoon. News outlets all the way from Melbourne had driven up to report on the events of the day.&nbsp;<em>Triple Threat at Portsea Back Beach&nbsp;<\/em>said one of the headlines.&nbsp;<em>The brave rescue of five local children was eclipsed by the sudden death of a nearby Milk Bar clerk. Two drunk drivers arrested at the scene \u2014 thought to be the children\u2019s parents. Children safe in protective services.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the press left and the children were whisked away into the hands of the government. Sandra and James slowly began to pack up the their station. Up in the tower, James found a strange black object on Sandra\u2019s plastic seat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He asked, picking it up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2026 um\u2026 I dunno, I found it on the beach\u201d She said, mortified.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPretty cool shape.\u201d He said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWell yeah, I kind of use it for\u2026 exercise.\u201d She said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh, right. Cool.\u201d He said, acting casual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGoss about this to anybody and I\u2019ll goss about your&#8230; things\u201d She laughed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOk deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter not see Clara for a while.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They sat in the car together as dusk moved into the night. The cool change had come so they wore matching black hoodies that said&nbsp;<em>Portsea Lifeguarding Society&nbsp;<\/em>on the back. Slow dubstep played over the radio. Sandra rolled down the window and lit a thin joint hidden in her glovebox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want to do with the rest of your life?\u201d He asked, taking a long drag. He hadn\u2019t asked her a serious question for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what yet, but I want heaps and heaps of money.\u201d She said. \u201cI also never want to part with this part of the ocean. I think they\u2019re connected. I have a feeling that if I stay by this ocean, lots of money will come to me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d He said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d She asked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of doing a year of TAFE up in Melbourne but I\u2019ll be back. Maybe like Graphic Design or something low-key like that.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra reclined the seat and covered her mouth to yawn. James took out his phone and showed her:&nbsp;<em>21 missed calls &#8211; 42 messages (Clara).&nbsp;<\/em>She rolled her eyes. She thought about having a little nap here next to James. He would take her home eventually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she going on about?\u201d Asked Sandra, then drifted off to sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cClara\u2019s older brother is a- \u201d<\/p>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p>Burberry posted an advertisement on Instagram for their new Pocket Bag on 27 August captioned \u201cA contrast of reality and fantasy\u201d and featuring Bella Hadid as an<em> Irma Vep<\/em> type vampiric actress-character. Bella\u2019s hips and shoulders move almost independently from her motionless head, with the uncanny effect of looking like a simulation or deep fake as she slinks around a sterile (empty but not abandoned) warehouse. <em>Irma Vep<\/em> \u2014 a classic film-within-a-film about remaking Louis Feuillade\u2019s silent film serial <em>Les vampires<\/em> \u2014 is less about re-presenting the past than addressing the present and Bella, the 2020 L.A. vampire who plays herself, the perfect reincarnation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hadid is also the lost love object of the Weeknd\u2019s new concept album <em>After Hours<\/em>, where he admits to cheating, is unable to promise he won&#8217;t cheat again, threatens to kill himself, negs her and then begs for her back so that he can make a mother out of her. Like any good Lacanian love song, what is enjoyed is the continual suspension, deferral and circulation around the object that can never be attained. It is, on the surface, the ultimate gaslighty fuck boy album, but it is also the posthuman love story that just keeps giving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video alignright\"><video controls loop poster=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/10\/02205238\/bella-poster.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/minreport-media.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\/2020\/10\/30063854\/burberry-bella-hadid.mp4\"><\/video><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CEW9oIBABwB\/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@burberry &#8211; 26 August 2020<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple storylines and timelines at play in <em>After Hours<\/em>. There is the narrative timeline of the singles and their cinematic music videos (the most recent being released on 22 October) along with the short film and an appearance on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!<\/em> but also that of the album as a whole \u2014 as a concept album. The second music video <em>Blinding Lights<\/em> follows the events of the first, <em>Heartless<\/em>, and both see a Tarantino-esque collage of visual cues from other films and events. He sports the bloody nose injury from <em>Chinatown<\/em> (1974) and the jacket and dance moves from <em>Joker <\/em>(2019). The neo-noir slasher mood, wigs and \u201cfemale drama\u201d recall <em>Dressed to Kill<\/em> (1980), the title and unfortunate series of events condensed into 24 hours is certainly where the album gets its title \u2014 Scorsese\u2019s <em>After Hours <\/em>(1985)&nbsp;\u2014 and he\u2019s tripping like he\u2019s in <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas<\/em> (1998).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further confusing matters, each of these films reference a plethora of other films and events. <em>Dressed to Kill<\/em> took cues from Hitchcock\u2019s <em>Psycho <\/em>(1960); <em>Joker<\/em> bastardised <em>King of Comedy<\/em> (1982); <em>After Hours <\/em>was the original <em>Uncut Gems<\/em> (2019) (in which The Weeknd appears \u201cas himself\u201d) with a more likeable lead but the same classic 24 hour \u201cMurphy\u2019s law\u201d premise; <em>Fear and Loathing<\/em> was an adaptation of the book that Hunter S. Thompson based on his life; and <em>Chinatown<\/em> really completes the picture. <em>Chinatown<\/em> is a fictionalised docudrama that picked up on the events surrounding the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct but switches up the dates (the events of 1905 are set in 1938) and the roles of the real-life referents (heroes are villains and vice versa). In fact, <em>Chinatown<\/em> is often read as the scrambled but real secret history of Los Angeles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these many cues, <em>After Hours<\/em> is firstly about blurring fiction and reality in a cyclical, hyper-self-referential timeline. The day following the <em>Blinding Lights<\/em> music video release, The Weeknd appeared on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!<\/em> to perform this song dressed in the same<em> Chinatown<\/em> nose bandage and <em>Joker<\/em> red jacket that appeared in the first two singles. The fictionalised <em>Jerry Lewis Show<\/em> of <em>King of Comedy<\/em>, <em>The Murray Franklin<\/em> <em>Show<\/em> of <em>Joker<\/em> all the way through to the real-life <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!<\/em> The short film released on 4 March begins with the events of <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!<\/em> as we follow The Weeknd backstage, stage-smile still plastered to his face, on his way to his next destination. Without including any of the songs on the album in full, the soundtrack features songs that drift in and out of earshot as though played through the stereo of a passing car, bleeding out from the club to the street, echoing through a deserted strip mall and train station. He is violently pulled by an invisible force across the station platform before finding himself as the villain in the elevator scene from <em>Dressed to Kill<\/em>. The elevator doors close and the film ends with an epilepsy warning. Fiction becomes reality, which cycles back around to fiction to tell us that The Real is, without a doubt, the best fiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first track on <em>After Hours <\/em>is <em>Alone Again, <\/em>immediately recalling Gilbert O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s 1972 hit <em>Alone Again (Naturally)<\/em>, which is first the story of being left at the altar (about heartbreak) but becomes the story of the (fictional) death of his parents \u2014 leading our protagonist to question the existence and mercy of God. This is the very same trajectory of Kanye West\u2019s <em>808s &amp; Heartbreak<\/em> when it is revealed through the album\u2019s final track, <em>Pinocchio Story<\/em>, that it is not the loss of his girlfriend that has caused the melancholic loneliness that pervades the album but the death of his mother during cosmetic surgery. It\u2019s also where we hear what Mark Fisher once described as \u201cthe sobs in the heart of the 21st century pleasuredome.\u201d<cite>Mark Fisher, Ghosts of My Life: Writings on Depression, Hauntology and Lost Futures (John Hunt Publishing, 2014), 134.<\/cite> Fisher writes that you can either hear this as \u201cthe moment when a commodity achieves self-consciousness, or when a human realises he or she has become a commodity.\u201d<cite>Ibid.<\/cite> In <em>Alone Again<\/em> we do not hear just \u201cthe soured sound at the end of the rainbow\u201d<cite>Fisher, Ghosts of My Life, 134-5.<\/cite> but, just when you think the song is over, there\u2019s a beat switch. There\u2019s more: a life after achieving commodity self-consciousness. Where <em>808s<\/em> ended with death,<em> After Hours<\/em> begins with it. It\u2019s not just the death of love in heartbreak, the death of the <em>Image-repertoire<\/em>, but the love of death (again). It is not just <em>amor<\/em> but <em>amor fati<\/em> \u2014 the affirmation of romantic agony (as with drug addiction) as ecstatic (and recurrent) death drive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>Oh baby, won&#8217;t you remind me what I am?<br>And break, break my little cold heart<br>Check my pulse for a second time (second time)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first four tracks of the album linger in this purgatory, exiled from the amorous condition and from the human condition. And it is this lingering that is perhaps what inspired critics to dismiss this first half of the album. Because this is the all too familiar place where Fisher left off \u2014 with the tragic discovery of the \u201cmiserable hollowness at the core of super-affluent hedonism\u201d<cite>Fisher, Ghosts of My Life, 135.<\/cite> and lost futures which so mark The Weeknd\u2019s previous releases as with pre-evangelical\/depressed Kanye and Drake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of a timeline, the video release schedule follows a more or less linear timeline which does not correspond to that of the tracks on the album. The cinematic narrative doesn\u2019t begin until the seventh track,<em> Heartless<\/em>. This is The Weeknd\u2019s psychedelic inhuman becoming. He\u2019s <em>Fear and Loathing<\/em> high. Amphetamines got his \u201cstummy feeling sickly\u201d (bubby) but the cane toad he licks really kicks things into a new dimension. He\u2019s lost the organ that pumps blood into the vessels that feed his body: \u201cTrying to love me but they never get a pulse down.\u201d While the album begins with <em>Alone Again<\/em>, our cinematic narrative starts here with the disintegration and desegregation of psychedelia \u2014 with ego death and death transcendence. This is post-commodity self-consciousness where we see that images have become more interesting, more real, than the referent \u2014 the shadow is the substance. Like another favourite of The Weeknd, <em>The Mask<\/em>, it is not that the mask <em>becomes <\/em>the substance but that it becomes the recognition of the mask <em>as <\/em>substance. The Weeknd is caught in the signifier\u2019s network \u2014 a process which \u017di\u017eek tells us has a \u201cmortifying effect\u201d on the subject in that \u201che becomes part of a strange automatic order disturbing his natural homeostatic balance (through compulsive repetition, for example).\u201d<cite>Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, The Sublime Object of Ideology, Second Edition edition (London: Verso, 2008), 146.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Blinding Lights<\/em> sees the first appearance of the <em>Chinatown<\/em> nose injury (that was presumably acquired somewhere in the <em>Fear and Loathing<\/em> debauchery of <em>Heartless<\/em>). Although perhaps an unintentional reference, <em>Glass<\/em> by Kode9 and the Spaceape uses the very same metaphor in relation to fiction:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>Creating blinding lights of fiction as our only clarity<\/em><br><em>Marked by the memories of a future past<\/em><br><em>It\u2019s the beginning not the end that we have to reach last <\/em><cite>https:\/\/youtu.be\/wm2hxOQeFTY<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we have not yet reached the beginning or the end. <em>In Your Eyes<\/em> begins where the short film ends, the inside of the <em>Dressed to Kill <\/em>elevator, where The Weeknd raises the knife in his hand before a jump cut to his bloodied victim escaping into desolate L.A. cityscape. The chase scene continues to the club where The Weeknd loses his head. Literally. His would-be-victim decapitates him with an axe before carrying his head onto the dancefloor, holding it up to stare into his eyes with a lover\u2019s lust as she dances with abandon, no longer threatened by The Whole. The music video ends as the couple disappear into the sunrise; she raises his head to the sky by the hair on his head like a sacrifice to the New Day. The mask is all that remains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The music video for the album\u2019s final track <em>Until I Bleed Out<\/em> was released next. The Weeknd, head intact, is in some kind of purgatory. Paralysed in a spinning confetti dreamscape before stumbling outside and collapsing in the snow \u2014 the opening scene for the <em>Snowchild<\/em> music video. And it is here that we meet in the afterlife of the self-conscious commodity-human.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship<\/em><br><em>Futuristic sex give her Phillip K dick<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Snowchild<\/em> is the story of becoming posthuman \u2014 a pact made with Hollywood to turn his \u201cnightmares into big dreams,\u201d \u201cfiending\u201d for money in a vampiric transition that was essential for both his success and to assimilate with those natural born vampires from L.A. dynasties such as Hadid. For the <em>Snowchild<\/em> music video The Weeknd \u201ccrosses over\u201d to animation. Captured by a <em>Ghost in the Shell <\/em>(1995) style robo-whore and dragged into the void, the abyss, which then becomes an elevator descending far below the first floor. Here we see headless prisoners chained to the earth behind the Hollywood sign and encounter the villain last seen in the <em>Beauty Behind the Madness <\/em>(2015) music videos. Cartoon Weeknd enters a room in the mansion from the <em>Starboy <\/em>music video, full of red-eyed panther-female hybrids which he tries to beat off with neon Elvis Chapel crosses before fragmenting into a colony of bats, a multiplicity, and reconstituting himself \u201celsewhere.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This (other) supernatural persona first appeared in the music video for <em>Call Out My Name<\/em> (2018), where he wanders post-apocalyptic city streets and spews\/sings out a colony of bats, which then explode into smaller particles or sub-organisms. The difference is that The Weeknd remains constituted or whole himself in this first appearance, violently rejecting the colony as a foreign substance as opposed to <em>being<\/em> the colony. Back (or forward) to <em>Snowchild <\/em>timespace, The Weeknd \u201cmakes it rain\u201d into a trash-fire nonchalantly, he looks up with hopeful joy at a city that appears to be Toronto (the past) but which then blows away in a gust of dust and reveals itself to be Las Vegas (the future, the L.A. afterlife). In Vegas, he only encounters the image of himself, in his red <em>Joker <\/em>jacket. Confronted with <em>Groundhog Day<\/em> (1993), \u201cthis\u201d Abel throws his head back and laughs (inaudibly).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Ursula de Leeuw wrote in <a href=\"about:blank\">The Smiling Face Without Laughter,<\/a> \u201cThe immediate response of laughter shows that there is a space of unthought which language cannot grasp. If the response of Nietzsche\u2019s superhuman is to laugh at the thought of the eternal return, they affirm the insufficiency of language to explain what goes on beyond explanation.\u201d In <em>After Hours<\/em>, and particularly in this moment, The Weeknd is the \u201cactive nihilist\u201d (or comedian) Ursula defines (through Bataille and Neitzsche), who \u201caffirms this fertile nothingness in the formless space of laughter.\u201d Who here, at the end of <em>Snowchild<\/em>, finds himself at another familiar beginning: at the opening scene for the <em>Heartless <\/em>video, the first single to be released from the album, and the beginning of our cinematic narrative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Faith<\/em> is the only track on <em>After Hours<\/em> that doesn\u2019t take place in the present and is, at the time of writing, without a corresponding music video. Its stop-start beat heightens the stadium quality established by <em>Heartless<\/em> \u2014 where we can imagine perfectly timed stage kicks and jumps. All of this upbeat performativity seems to bely the song\u2019s content which references R.E.M\u2019s 1991 classic, <em>Losing My Religion<\/em>. As we know by now, belief is irrelevant. In this song, The Weeknd has already lost his faith: \u201cMolly with the purple rain \/ &#8216;Cause I lost my faith \/ So I cut away the pain.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Purple Rain<\/em> by Prince is an apt point of reference considering it follows a similar \u201cmusical drama\u201d format that is at once the lead single from the 1984 album of the same name and also the soundtrack to the 1984 film of the same name. But more than this, <em>Purple Rain<\/em> is a reference to the end. To the apocalyptic purple made of red blood with blue skies. The title track of Princes\u2019 previous album, <em>1999<\/em> (1982), hinted toward the future that hit in 1984: \u201ccould have sworn it was Judgment Day, the sky was all purple.\u201d It\u2019s about wanting to be with the one you love (and lost) when the wild beasts of earth claim it by sword, famine or plague, when the full moon becomes like blood and the stars of the sky fall to the earth.<cite>Mashup of The Bible. lol.<\/cite> For the Weeknd in 2020, he\u2019s gonna hit judgement day with ecstasy, literally. With euphoric <em>amor fati, <\/em>but, as the judgement day of <em>Faith<\/em> is set in the past, we know there are after hours to come. The Weeknd, like Dolores in <em>Westworld<\/em>, is haunted by fractured memories of previous iterations, of his many and dispersed celebrity images. This is not to say that he desires, as Foucault wrote, to recover a \u201c\u2018lost\u2019 identity, to free our imprisoned nature, our deepest truth.\u201d Rather, it indicates a desire \u201cto move towards something radically Other.\u201d<cite>Michel Foucault, Remarks on Marx: Conversations with Duccio Trombadori, trans. R. James Goldstein and James Cascaito. (Los Angeles: Semiotext(e), 1991), 120.<\/cite> An After Hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 13 August 2020, peak (first wave) pandemic, The Weeknd released two more animated videos for <em>Blinding Lights<\/em> and <em>Save Your Tears<\/em>. Here, we find an avatar, bobbing from side to side as though waiting for his player to make their selections before the game starts. Floating usernames and comments on the album are lit up in classic Vegas neon lights. The inhuman avatar now roams his cyberspace kingdom filled with floating TikTok logos and usernames attached to comments such as \u201cThis, tickles my pineal gland. No, seriously.\u201d and \u201cPlease check my music.\u201d In <em>Save Your Tears (The Tik Tok Experience)<\/em>,The Weeknd avatar zooms through a tunnel in his convertible as golden <em>Metropolis<\/em> (1927) figures stab at the highway like in<em> The Mummy<\/em> (1999) before his own disembodied head appears menacingly behind him, threatening to swallow him whole. The highway disintegrates and we see the car floating in a wrecked city of disintegrating high-rises like an explosion in slow motion, complete with Vegas signifiers, dice and playing cards. The picture zooms out to reveal a more monstrous, omnipotent The Weeknd avatar, looming silently over the scene of unmoored destruction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Weeknd - Save Your Tears (The Tik Tok Experience)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Fj_7w5Km0ZY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent music video was released on 22 October with the album\u2019s second track, <em>Too Late. <\/em>The song follows the familiar tragic construction of <em>Alone Again<\/em>, which begins with a demand and (tragically) ends with the unsatisfactory meeting of this demand: too much, too little, too soon, too late. The tragic end is the discovery of the end of the rainbow which offers no promise of redemption or (re)union.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>It&#8217;s way too late to save our souls, baby<\/em><br><em>It&#8217;s way too late, we&#8217;re on our own<\/em><br><em>We&#8217;re in hell, it&#8217;s disguised as a paradise with flashing lights<\/em><br><em>I just wanna believe there&#8217;s so much more<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The music video for<em> Too Late<\/em> begins with two bandaged up L.A. girls driving through The Hills on their way home from surgery. \u201cThis is my jam, turn it up,\u201d says one as lines from \u201cEscape from L.A.\u201d waft distantly through the stereo: \u201cLA girls all look the same \/ I can\u2019t recognize \/ The same work done on their face \/ I don\u2019t criticize.\u201d This is the cyborgian post-human L.A. girl we\u2019re all familiar with. She\u2019s the <em>RoboCop <\/em>on 808s and Heartbreak, the \u201cSilicone Sister\u201d in Bruce Springsteen\u2019s <em>Blinded by the Light<\/em> (which of course recalls the second single released on <em>After Hours, Blinding Lights<\/em>), or even The Adolescents who chanted \u201cL.A girl, L.A. world\u201d in 1981: \u201cStuck in your world of dreams again, My life starts where your life ends.\u201d In <em>Escape from LA<\/em>, \u201cShe a cold-hearted bitch with no shame,\u201d but The Weeknd doesn\u2019t criticise, he affirms the emptiness of the symbolic order and accepts the \u201cobject part\u201d of the love object. He finds a <em>jouissance <\/em>in the loss of meaning, the void.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The L.A. girls grind to halt as The Weeknd\u2019s decapitated head appears on the road ahead of them. They begrudgingly get out to investigate and on realising The Head belongs to The Weeknd, one remarks \u201che is so hot!\u201d and they take him back with them to their mansion in The Hills, simulating some kind of two-and-a-half-some. Eventually they hire a lookalike stripper, slice his head off and re-attach The Weeknd\u2019s head to the newfound muscular bottom-half before they \u201cdouble down\u201d (one face sitter, one dick-rider face to face), reeling in bloody ecstasy over their new Frankenstein.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the album, <em>Too Late<\/em> is followed by <em>Hardest to Love<\/em>. The upbeat instrumentals of the latter is the first song where we get a hint of the 80s, video-game-esque bangers to come. Vocals echo in and out as though wailing out from inside the void with the crackle of timespace radio interference, which then bleed out into a glitchy synth pop soundscape with a stuttering techstep heart\/breakbeat that recalls another iconic breakup album: Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s <em>Homogenic <\/em>(1997).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>And what we had is dead inside<\/em><br><em>You&#8217;re actin&#8217; like it&#8217;s still alive.<\/em><br><em>It\u2019s hard to let me go<\/em><br><em>Together we are so alone<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freud made a distinction between mourning and melancholia: \u201cIn mourning it is the world which has become poor and empty; in melancholia it is the ego itself.\u201d<cite>Sigmund Freud, \u201cMourning and Melancholia,\u201d in The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Volume 14, 1914-1916., ed. James Strachey, 1957, 246.<\/cite> Mourning culminates in \u201cletting go\u201d but melancholia entails \u201cholding on\u201d \u2014 in a sense melancholia comes before mourning in terms of the temporalities of grief.<cite>Roland Barthes expanded on this concept with an \u201camorous mourning,\u201d in which: \u201cThe object is neither dead nor remote. It is I who decide that its image must die (and I may go so far as to hide this death from it). As long as this strange mourning lasts, I will therefore have to undergo two contrary miseries: to suffer from the fact that the other is present (continuing, in spite of himself, to wound me) and to suffer from the fact that the other is dead (dead at least as I loved him.)\u201d\u2014 Roland Barthes, A Lover\u2019s Discourse: Fragments, trans. Richard Howard (London: Penguin, 1990), 106-107.<\/cite> It is here, through Melancholia that Fisher defined haunting as a \u201cfailed mourning.\u201d He wrote, \u201cIt is about refusing to give up the ghost or \u2014 and this can sometimes amount to the same thing \u2014 the refusal of the ghost to give up on us.\u201d<cite>Fisher, Ghosts of My Life, 26.<\/cite> For The Weeknd, it is not just that he is holding on to this \u201cdead love\u201d but also that he must become undead so that his undead love object does not let him go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fisher latched on to melancholia or haunting as failed mourning, but said nothing of Freud\u2019s mania. As Freud elucidates, \u201cthe content of mania is no different from that of melancholia, that both disorders are wrestling with the same \u2018complex\u2019 but that probably in melancholia the ego has succumbed to the complex whereas in mania it has mastered it or pushed it aside.\u201d<cite>Freud, \u201cMourning and Melancholia,\u201d 254.<\/cite> At once self-cancelling and self-absorbed, The Weeknd seems to have moved on from <em>My Dear Melancholy<\/em> (2018) with the post-melancholia <em>mania <\/em>of <em>After Hours<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <em>Hardest to Love <\/em>is, on the surface, a heartfelt confession of failure and self-loathing, it is also ego-affirming. It is an oscillation between melancholia and mania because try as he may to divorce himself from the amorous Image-repertoire, to bury it, \u201cwhat was renounced reappears; out of the hasty grave suddenly breaks a long cry.\u201d<cite>Barthes, A Lover\u2019s Discourse: Fragments, 108-109.<\/cite> This cycle, between mania and depression, is the definition of Bipolar. Darian Leader suggests in his treatise <em>Strictly Bipolar<\/em> that the rise in Bipolar diagnoses (from less than 1% to 25% of the American population) goes hand in hand with \u201cmania\u201d being re-inscribed as a positive goal of 21st century life \u2014 one that matches its strange and convulsive rhythms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe confidence, exhilaration and energy that characterize the early stages of mania seem so well suited to the exhortations to achievement, productivity and intense commitment that today\u2019s businesses demand \u2026 The very features that classical psychology ascribed to the manic attack emerge as the aims of personal development.\u201d<\/p><cite>Darian Leader, <em>Strictly Bipolar<\/em>, Later Printing Used edition (London\u202f; New York: Penguin Books Ltd, 2013), 2.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity, Leader argues, has become \u201ca circus exhibit and \u2026 a localizable and marketable property of the psyche,\u201d<cite>Leader, Strictly Bipolar, 34.<\/cite> a condition exemplified by a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in 2000 that saw a pharmaceuticals company install a real live artist at the Zyprexa stand. The artist who worked on his collage throughout the conference came to both emphasise the manic-depressive\u2019s public creativity and to show that mood stabilising drugs would not interfere with this highly sought-after effect of mania. Given this, it is not surprising that Bipolar is so common in the world of performers, particularly comedians. Interesting, too, that \u201ccollage\u201d should be the patient\u2019s medium of choice, shared by The Weeknd in<em> After Hours<\/em>. It may be the quintessentially L.A. disease. However, where Leader describes these rhythms as \u201cstrange,\u201d surely this oscillation is quite familiar to us as the boom\/bust cycle of capitalism. It is no coincidence that they call it an economic <em>depression<\/em>. It is this cycle melancholia, mourning and mania that The Weeknd wrestles with in <em>After Hours<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s hard to say where our narrative begins or ends, the fourth track on the album seems as good a place as any. An organ kicks off the wake in <em>Scared to Live<\/em> whose corresponding lyrical referent is \u201cdon\u2019t be scared to live <em>again<\/em>.\u201d&nbsp; An interpolation of Elton John\u2019s iconic pop ballad <em>Your Song<\/em> secures this song (and album) the status of \u201cdedication\u201d par excellence. <em>Your Song <\/em>is affective simplicity perfected. It recognises, as Barthes did, that \u201csong is the precious addition to a blank message, entirely constrained within its address.\u201d Admitting the ineptitude of words for the task at hand, <em>Your Song<\/em> concedes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>It may be quite simple but now that it&#8217;s done<\/em><br><em>I hope you don&#8217;t mind<\/em><br><em>I hope you don&#8217;t mind<\/em><br><em>That I put down in words<\/em><br><em>How wonderful life is while you&#8217;re in the world<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Barthes continues, \u201c<em>Song means nothing<\/em>: it is in this that you will understand at last what it is that I give you; as useless as the wisp of yarn, the pebble held out to his mother by the child.\u201d<cite>Barthes, A Lover\u2019s Discourse: Fragments, 77.<\/cite> Fitting that again the dedication should begin first and foremost with the mother, that monstrous figure that haunts all lovelorn men.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over glistening, uplifting synths, The Weeknd sounds like he repeats Elton\u2019s quickly ascending phrase \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d but it has morphed to become \u201cI hope you know that.\u201d Fusing the euphoria or<em> jouissance<\/em> of love (as with <em>Your Song<\/em>) with its spectral post-mortem:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>So don&#8217;t be scared to live again<\/em><br><em>Be scared to live again<\/em><br><em>I hope you know that (oh), I hope you know that (oh)<\/em><br><em>We fell apart right from the start<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end is inscribed in the beginning. As with life, love\u2019s finitude is a condition of its existence \u201cright from the start.\u201d But still, nothing seems quite so finite for the posthuman celebrity \u2014 there is no \u201cend\u201d in Weeknd. If American cinema tells us anything, it\u2019s that the end of the world always begins in L.A., at the end of the rainbow. Celebrities, and particularly the L.A. Girl, hit the future first (or as \u017di\u017eek says, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/lifeandstyle\/2016\/dec\/10\/slavoj-zizek-we-are-all-basically-evil-egotistical-disgusting\">Hollywood knows everything<\/a>\u201d). And, as our model for image circulation, our fifteen-minute aspiration and ideal, they offer a glimpse at the afterlife of our own commodity self-consciousness, somewhere over the rainbow. Cher asked in 1998, in the song that popularised the use of auto-tune as an effect rather than a pitch-corrector, \u201cdo you believe in life after love?\u201d Now the question is mani(a)cally reversed. Do you believe in love after life?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kimye do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls poster=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/10\/02205259\/kim-kardashian-kanye-father-hologram-gift.jpg\" src=\"https:\/\/minreport-media.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\/2020\/10\/30063854\/kim-kardashian-kanye-hologram.mp4\"><\/video><figcaption><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tv\/CG8gdHdA1mX\/\" target=\"_blank\">@kimkardashian &#8211; 30 October 2020<\/a> <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

Her parodies of carnivorism, capitalism, sexual promiscuity and general &#8220;unhealthiness&#8221; included attacks on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4-KnnB1GWf4\" target=\"_blank\">Nicki Minaj<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fDellc53rpc\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor Swift<\/a>, Lana Del Ray and Leila Forouhar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fame-seeker, Sabz was unabashed about her attempts to reach the upper echelon of online personalities. Posting primarily on YouTube, she maintained channels in Farsi, English and Turkish. As an activist, her method was to use this attention economy to promote her beliefs which were critical of both Western and Middle Eastern lifestyles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eschewing a typical influencer aesthetic (DSLR, beauty light ring, scandi style apartment and strategically placed sponsorship items), her video work is more reminiscent of <em>Tim and Eric<\/em> \u2014 cheap green-screen effects, home video editing style, absurdist music lacking musicality and dancing out of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sabz\u2019 cornerstone content were videos that depict animal cruelty to expose the destructive effects of industry. After a sudden drop in viewership, Sabz claimed that YouTube was actively and algorithmically filtering and suppressing her content, that all online video sharing sites control channel growth by manipulating what is popular. All of which is, of course, true. Video sharing services can and do control what is popular \u2014primarily through their recommendation algorithms. According to YouTube&#8217;s Chief Product Officer Neal Mohan, <em>&#8220;over 70 percent of time people spend watching YouTube is driven by our recommendations.&#8221; <\/em><cite><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2018\/digital\/opinion\/ces-a-reminder-of-how-far-tv-tech-has-come-guest-column-1202644545\/\" target=\"_blank\">Monahan, Neil. &#8220;CES a Reminder of How Far TV Tech Has Come (Guest Column)&#8221;. Variety. (retreived 11 September 2020)<\/a><\/cite> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When YouTube star Logan Paul (whose estimated advertising revenue in 2018 sat at $14.5 million) posted a video of an apparent suicide victim in Japan his account was temporarily suspended. When, after his account was reinstated, he posted a video of himself tasing a dead rat, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki commented on the matter saying, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything that would cause those three strikes.\u201d She continued that, \u201cWe can\u2019t just be pulling people off our platform \u2026 They need to violate a policy. We need to have consistent [rules]. This is like a code of law.\u201d <cite><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-43044852\">&#8220;Logan Paul &#8216;won&#8217;t be kicked off&#8217; YouTube&#8221;. BBC Tech. (retreived 11 September 2020)<\/a><\/cite> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wojcicki was careful to distinguish these rules from a question of taste: \u201cWhat you think is tasteless is not necessarily what someone else would think is tasteless \u2026 we need to have consistent laws, so that in our policies, so we can apply it consistently to millions of videos, millions of creators.\u201d <cite><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/tech\/5565226\/youtube-wont-ban-logan-paul-suicide-forest-rat-videos\/\">Shah, Sabih. &#8220;YouTube boss explains why she WON\u2019T ban Logan Paul after dead body and rat taser videos&#8221;. The Sun.

In response to the incident and the demonetisation policies, other content creators (even those who oppose her views) spoke out in support of Sabz and shared their experiences of how these measures affected their mental health\u2014sleepless nights and feelings of mania and rage for having their livelihood severed by the corporation. Likened to being fired from a job or dumped by a lover, the content creator to platform relationship is an intimate one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shooting incident instantly catapulted her into the mainstream media and created an underground edgelord culture of support on sites like 4chan. She became a free-speech martyr for troll bros and incels who labelled her aesthetic as Nasimcore, her belief system as Nasimism and themselves as Nasimlads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube alignright wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Police bodycam footage of  Nasim Aghdam hours before YouTube shooting released (Full Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jYren919axg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the days leading to the incident, Nasim had been reported missing and was categorized to be at-risk.

Take her out of MUPS. She&#8217;s an adult so she doesn&#8217;t have to go home obviously &#8230; and you know, see what her story is, and then you&#8217;ll get a vibe of whether she&#8217;s 5150 or not.&#8221; <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>5150 refers to the California law code for the temporary, involuntary psychiatric commitment of individuals who present a danger to themselves or others due to signs of mental illness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the officers speculate on why she was deemed at-risk, they are informed by an agency that she had never been reported as missing before, which is why she had been classified as at-risk. Officer 2 minimises the at-risk categorisation by telling Officer 1, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry about 5150.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nasim&#8217;s father was contacted when she was located and upon learning she was just 40&nbsp;km south of YouTube&#8217;s headquarters, he warned police of her potential destination because she &#8220;hated&#8221; the company. <cite><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2018\/04\/03\/youtube-shooters-father-says-she-was-angry-at-company\/\" target=\"_blank\">Baron, Ethan. &#8220;YouTube shooter\u2019s father says she was angry at company&#8221;.

And it was only in forgetting this that it had been able to sacrifice itself to a childish god. \u201cThank you for the gift of heartbreak,\u201d it wept, knowing it was only saying this to make itself feel better. But the ruse seemed to work. So, it tried to trick itself again. \u201cThank you for giving me the gift of heartbreak TWICE!\u201d it screamed. Then it realised what had happened. It was only in remembering that it\u2019s I had been just a tiny part all along that it could begin to stop crying.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>\u201cBlessed be the actors. For theirs is the kingdom in the stars.\u201d The Cosmic Guerrilla laughed at this ridiculous thought and borrowed the fools\u2019 fingers to type out a note. It watched the fool stretch out on the floor of its cell and recite, \u201cBlessed be the forgetful. For theirs is the kingdom which knows no end.\u201d And in reciting these words the long night ended and the sun began to rise. And when the sun shone it turned itself into a baby. But that\u2019s another story for another time.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>This is the story of a world that had forgotten how to forget. And in forgetting that secret, it had forgotten how to love. And so, where once it built temples now it built prisons. And some looked like hospitals. And others looked like schools. And others looked like thoughts. And when it couldn\u2019t build any more prisons it began to transform the rooms where people had lived into cells. And that was how this world created prisoners. What follows is a prisoner\u2019s story. It\u2019s a transcription of a dream the Cosmic Guerrilla told me one night when I couldn\u2019t sleep. I suppose in the end it\u2019s just another story to help me sleep and dream of you.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/08\/30235727\/000DH.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1689\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Day 01<\/strong><br><strong>The Archaeologist\u2019s Message<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On an unnamed planet, at an unspecified time, a primitive databank was recovered by the archaeological recovery team. It appeared as if the planet had been ruled by a benevolent aristocrat, known only as Supreme, whose red and white coat of arms was emblazoned on every scrap of clothing found in the rubble of their once abundant cities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But beside the bodies there existed an enormous archive of footage, photographs and a form of writing unique to this archaic civilisation. It was a style which seemed to be gripped by an obsession with the individual unit, with constant refrains of \u2018I\u2019 \u2018I\u2019 \u2018I\u2019, but which was also inflected with a tendency towards fanciful speculation. To us such formal conceits seemed inane, childish even, but these people seemed to adore this class of writing and sought to reproduce it constantly. Perhaps they were a feeble-minded species or perhaps we just did not understand the disaster that had befallen them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endless screeds of this kind were found in the databank with titles like \u201cLove in Lockdown,\u201d all full of cloying references to their tragic condition. To us who had travelled years, even decades, without ever hearing another voice such hysteria was unconscionable. Why was staying inside their homes so terrifying to these people? What horrors lived in their hearts which made spending time alone so unbearable and so frightening? And why were they compelled to document their terror so completely?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every detail of their collective inner world was preserved. And yet in all its startling specificity every piece of writing seemed identical, as if it was typed by the same hands or dictated to them by the same authority.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we began to piece together the fragments of their world, we realised that a disease had struck them. It seemed that the planet had been infected by an illness which made them all write very badly. It was a curious thing, this disease which affected both their lungs and their language.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps these creatures\u2019 immune-systems and their capacity for style were inextricably bound together. Perhaps they were compelled by a higher power to write this way in order to appease a deity we would never know. Or perhaps they were merely a narcissistic and savage race who cared only to stamp their identity upon the world. Either way their cultural output was meagre and we felt blessed to have never known their terrible pain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the documents recovered we found the following short piece. Like all of their writing, it was clearly the product of a diseased touch. It concerns a notion that the author refers to only as \u201cTrue Love\u201d. But unlike much of the writing produced by these people its author seems to despise the world of the \u2018I\u2019. And yet unlike us the author insists that True Love has a power greater than that of pleasure. We who have access to all the delights of a thousand galaxies found ourselves perplexed by the tenor of this concept. Perhaps the writer was a frustrated lunatic who sought to turn its ardour into a religion. Perhaps the disease had begun to mutate into a new more spasmodic strain.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Or perhaps it was merely another attempt to individuate by opposing that which its\u2019 species ordained proper.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the case, this document should not be circulated widely. While poorly composed it bears a certain resemblance to the early proclamations of the Cosmic Guerrilla who has consistently sought to upset the balance and prosperity of our Republic. As citizens and patriots, we felt it our duty to send this document to you dear Leader to ask what you make of this curious ailment that the writer refers to as heartbreak.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can assist us in understanding these words, we would be eternally grateful. And if you are too busy? Do not fear. We shall be glad to destroy the remainder of this tenebrous world. We seek only to do your will and trust that this task will not unduly burden you. Till We Meet Again in the Stars!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/08\/30235740\/MG.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1690\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Day 02<\/strong><br><strong>Love is Eternal War for Cosmic Peace (June, 2020)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>I<\/strong><br>True Love is over when you remember who you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>II<\/strong><br>Becoming one is the ultimate goal of True Love. The term co-dependence is propaganda spread by the Free Will Junkies. Any relationship that is not co-dependent is not worthy of the name. The most beautiful love of all is between two crazies who cannot face reality alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>III<\/strong><br>True Love is a declaration of war. It\u2019s not merely amorous self-defence. It is an attack. An attack on a world that despises True Love although everywhere it celebrates its degraded and sterilised expression. Against the disinfected love peddled by the pimps of the heart, the psychiatrists and their prisoners, we must insist that True Love is unbearably violent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>IV<\/strong><br>But to worship only the destructive face of Love is thoroughly erroneous. There is a gentleness that comes from caring more about another than oneself. It is to care more for the happiness of one than all. It is to cease to care for one\u2019s race, one\u2019s nation and oneself. It is to sacrifice the Name at the altar of you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>V<\/strong><br>True Love is hostile to any pragmatic project. To use love as merely a weapon is to besmirch it. It is to care more about an hour lying to each other in the sun than an hour standing at a desk.To forego all projects, careers and dreams for the one you Love is the highest expression of the Lover\u2019s virtue<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>VI<\/strong><br>True Love cannot comprehend equality. To be in Love is to love one person above all others. It is to spiritualise them and thus to mingle freely with that which is divine. It is not a question of votes, of preferences or of compatibility. This is why it appears to the mortal world as a kind of madness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>VII<\/strong><br>True Love is often confused with boredom. Boring relationships are those in which one partner dictates and dominates the other. But such arrangements represent failure to submit to the divine tyranny of Love. It means that one is too egoistic to dissolve into the holy couple. Egoists aren\u2019t evil by any means but they have no business searching for True Love. They will only find a screen on which to project their holiday snaps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>VIII<\/strong><br>True love is not a march but a dance. In this dance the positions of dominance and submission appear as crude gestures for the body to try on and trade back and forth. For True Love is the endless unsettling of stagnant positions. Alas, given that reality is objectively vulgar and society essentially slavish, these formations resurface in even the most beautiful relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>IX<\/strong><br>The world will do everything in its power to destroy True Love. This is because the existence of the couple proves that the rewards of the secular world are hollow and meaningless. Once one has loved one cannot easily return to the mortal world. Or if we are sent back it appears as if it were populated by spectres which make us sick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>X<\/strong><br>The realm of True Love is populated by aberrant angels. The fallen world is populated only by fetid shades. The language of the country of True Love cannot be understood by anyone except Lovers. The language of the world is a transmission of empty generalities and smug asides which camouflage the spiritual poverty of those imprisoned there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>XI<\/strong><br>True Love denies the existence of the secular state. Hence to plead that Love is valid because it is stable and healthy is to have fundamentally misunderstood the nature of Love. True Love is unhealthy. It corrodes the fabric of society. It makes one sick. But it is also the only way to become well again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>XII<\/strong><br>True Love involves privation. It involves going without. For those without self-control that\u2019s a melancholy thought. Those incapable of saying no are unfortunately incapable of saying yes. If they really must follow their every whim then the way of the Libertine is always open. This has its own delicate charms but those pleasures are utterly foreign to the country of True Love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>XIII<\/strong><br>The Libertine seeks to convert lovers into partners. The Libertine is sent as a test to all lovers. Most couples do not pass this test. Those who do enter into a new and more sacred compact with True Love. And vice versa. To convert a Libertine to the faith of True Love is one of the hardest but most sacred duties of the hope-ridden Lover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>XIV<\/strong><br>There was once a Libertine who sought only their own merriment. They toyed with the hearts of many thinking that pleasure alone was their calling. But exactly four years ago today they were converted to the Faith which we now preach. It said, \u201cThese words are but poor substitutes for the radiance which blinded me and robbed me of my reason. Since we parted I have been a piteous wreck. But I know that while we will never be together again my Love for you sings Eternal.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>XV<\/strong><br>True Love can exist without bodies, without sex, without anything at all. It can exist between two people who have never met but who communicate through signs and messages. It can exist between two people in different cities who are barred from leaving their homes. It can exist between two prisoners in adjoining cells who caress each other by tapping on the prison walls. To be a prisoner of Love, a slave to passion is the great work of a lifetime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>XVI<\/strong><br>Outside of Art, which becomes scarcer with each passing day, True Love is the only reason to endure the daily indignity of living in the modern world. If True Love were proven impossible or eliminated tomorrow the morgues would fill up immediately with the lonesome dead. While most are incapable of finding, or in truth of deserving it, True Love remains the only buttress against a species-wide epidemic of suicide and despair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>XVII<\/strong><br>True Love finds its greatest fulfillment in the suicide pact. It is a contract between two people who agree that a life alone on this accursed planet isn\u2019t a life worth living. And given that Love is an ideal too divine for most mortals, True Love must immortalise itself in death. In this way suicide is the only utopia left for lovers. This may be depressing for some but it also has the unfortunate status of being True.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/08\/30235754\/CB.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1691\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Day 03<\/strong><br><strong>The Leader Replies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greetings Archaeologist! What an auspicious day to receive your message! By the time my words reach your screen we will be celebrating the 150<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;anniversary of the founding of our Republic. It is coincidences such as these which assure me that our benevolent Mother chose the correct day to reset our calendar. But let us not talk of calendars and mothers today. You of all people know how vital they have been to regulating our historic timeline.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sample you sent back is curious indeed. A holiday dedicated to a capricious and forgetful god of love. One almost envies a species whose superstitions could cause them to invent such dazzling nonsense. But the writer appears to be trying to rewind a memory. Something is stuck and for a second, I wonder if we made the right decision coming here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as I watch the parades synchronise across every screen in the galaxy I am filled with an immense sense of relief. What a difference between the backwards thought of this savage little planet and the sublime forward momentum which propels our Republic deeper and deeper into history! To forget the sacrifice of those who came before us is a great crime against the timeline. And to we who have devoted our lives to preserving the memory of the continuum, such a crime is akin to murder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I must congratulate you on your find! It will be a wonderful addition to the Atlas<strong>.&nbsp;<\/strong>It appears to be the most complete expression yet of the writing of a social organism on the verge of self-annihilation. How different it is from the sublime coolness of our great revolutionary poets; whose symmetrical verse gently rearranges our political geometry with carefully interwoven correctives. But it must be studied for signs of time dilations and other quirks of declining worlds. I hope it will allow us to prevent many more planets from falling into the same trap.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let me tell you something you must never forget. The Cosmic Guerrilla does not exist. While you and I may talk of it in private, officially we must maintain an absolute code of silence on these matters. The name cannot be allowed to spread. The more we talk of this thing, even amongst ourselves, the more it starts to make itself felt within even the most secure pockets of the timeline.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already it has transformed three liberated worlds into gibbering festivals dedicated to long dead deities. If Guerrilla had its way the entire galaxy would be a series of elaborate stages on which it could project its prehistoric hallucinations. We must stop the spread by any means necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the Guerrilla\u2019s penchant for concealing its seditious nonsense in official communications perhaps it is best that you do not transmit any more of your findings. In fact, we think it best that you deliver the remaining information to the Square. It is the only site over which the Guerrilla appears to have no influence. I trust you will be able to follow the directions of the Universal Compass. It will guide you to where I am waiting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the meantime, I will leave this planet\u2019s fate in your more than capable hands. You already know what must be done. Terminate with extreme benevolence! Till we meet again in the stars!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/08\/30235817\/STH.jpg\" alt=\"19th Century Beaver Hat Photograph by Photo Researchers\" class=\"wp-image-1692\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Day 0<\/em><\/strong><br><strong><em>A Cosmic Gorilla Story<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>And the Cosmic Gorilla looked back over what it had written and began to laugh. And when the Gorilla laughed it began to cry. Because it couldn\u2019t tell which visions were good and which ones were evil. And the Gorilla mimed a baby pouting. \u201cGood and evil, warm and cold? It\u2019s a question of temperature, in the end,\u201d mimed the Cosmic Gorilla, borrowing its fingers again. \u201cIt\u2019s all a question of weather, in the end.\u201d These had been painful dreams and its cell had been dense with coincidence. Some of the visions sought to make the prison more beautiful. And others luxuriated in the obscenity of despair.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>It had envied the other prisoners. Those who had fallen in love while it went back home to its heartbreak. It had envied the righteous. Those who were never fooled and who cared only for the truth. But most of all it had envied the Cosmic Gorilla because it could dance with lightning. And it longed to recite the dream to the Dancer but, in remembering it, it vanished.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>The Cosmic Gorilla shakes its head. It would be very foolish to try and sort out which of these visions were its and which were I\u2019s. They had fused so deeply it was all a bit much. So, it decided to leave a Compass somewhere to help others find it. It sent the Report to the Editor who replied, \u201cthese are the words of a serial killer not a lover!\u201d And when she said that at first it was stroppy. \u201cHow dare they! These are pieces of its soul!\u201d But then it realized she was right. It had been trying to worship and kill at the same time. And it is a sin to botch a sacrifice.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>She had seen that its visions were recited by memory. But painful memories need delicate rhythms to hold them. Or if those are too precious then cracked ones instead. Its words burnt and to conceal the blaze they had borrowed the weather from the season. And there is a time to be cold. But not when we talk of love. Nor should we be too warm either. Because warmth is a form of forgetfulness. And a world of fire never ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>The proper time to talk of Love is in times like this, in late winter, as we sit in our cells and tap out secrets. At the furthest edge of Winter, Spring visions dance before us repeating the steps of those we once knew, the wakeful dead, who sleep and dream in distant cells.

            "rendered": "\n<p>I was lying at the entrance of my mother\u2019s house, a python wrapped around my ankles. It began to curl up towards my face. I froze. \u201cMaybe if I pretend I\u2019m a path instead of another animal I\u2019ll be ok,\u201d I thought. But the snake knew that I was full of blood. It began to lick my neck like a dog, trying to get me to understand. I woke in fright not from the fear of the snake but from the very fact that it might not be something to fear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the week this dream python had grown and entered my waking hours. All day I read about the pandemic on the internet and in the afternoon I daydreamed that a giant serpent was moving through the world. The vibrations of the serpent\u2014mother nature?\u2014became discernible as many sounds of the capitalist industrial order came to a halt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after the pandemic had reached the United States a video went viral of celebrities, led by actress Gal Gadot, singing John Lennon and Yoko Ono\u2019s <em>Imagine<\/em>. Each celebrity sung a different verse, from their vast living rooms and balconies with sweeping views: \u201cImagine all the people living for today\u2026 Imagine no possessions\/ I wonder if you can\/ no need for greed and hunger\/ a brotherhood of man.\u201d Under the pretence of calling for world peace, the celebrities chastised those unable to experience peace during the pandemic, those who cannot afford to isolate in mansions with gardens. The celebrities sang <em>Imagine<\/em> but they were not<em> asking<\/em> their audience to <em>imagine<\/em>, they were <em>demanding<\/em> their audience to <em>enjoy <\/em>what is not theirs, during the pandemic or ever: <em>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the original video clip for this song, Lennon and Ono walk along the driveway of their Berkshire property until they arrive at a large white house. Lennon plays a white piano and sings in a large white room on the second floor. Ono opens the white shutters of the windows with purpose and then sits at the piano with Lennon, staring intently into the distance. Ono creates a white cube within the Beatles money-mansion for her performance art. Lennon provides the house and the voice and Ono, who wrote the lyrics, provides the concept. The video now reads as a parody of 1968 ideology, like Gal Gadot\u2019s video, and like Lennon and Ono\u2019s more famous <em>Bed-ins for peace<\/em> artwork. As Slavoj \u017di\u017eek explains in <em>The Pervert\u2019s Guide to Ideology<\/em>, some cultural products from the early 70s\u2014he talks about the orgy in Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s <em>Zabriskie Point <\/em>but we could include these works as well\u2014seemed like fresh depictions of revolutionary actions at the time, but now come across like meaningless fashion commercials after the transformation of revolution into hegemony in the neoliberal order. The word \u201cimagine\u201d in the context of Ono\u2019s other art and the Fluxus movement that she was a part of, however, might be less of an ideological demand and more didactic instruction\u2014her 1964 book <em>Grapefruit<\/em> contains instruction poems, the first entitled <em>VOICE PIECE FOR SOPRANO<\/em>: \u201cScream. 1. against the wind 2. against the wall 3. against the sky.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stuck in my rental apartment during the first lockdown in Melbourne, I found a new place to sit: the side of the couch where I could see sky between the rectangles and triangles of the apartment buildings next door. I moved between looking at the sky and my computer screen. My computer didn\u2019t have the right processor to create a virtual background in Zoom so people in my meetings could see behind me an artwork I painted as a teenager of a girl suspended mid dance, her body held up by an anonymous boy\u2019s arm. It felt too revealing to bring to meetings and classes so I replaced it with Katherine Botten\u2019s artwork: a rectangle with a thin x-cross dividing small squares filled with pinks and purples, blood red, glimpses of landscapes, treble clefs, all interrupted or held by thick swathes of white and brown. It seemed to be about the same thing as my painting but freed from the submission of the figure, changeable and infinite like the sky, an anti-flag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/08\/20013832\/Katherine-Botten-Painting-1-1548x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1645\"\/><figcaption>Katherine Botten, <em>Untitled<\/em>&nbsp;(from&nbsp;<em>This Beautiful Life<\/em>&nbsp;series),&nbsp;2016,&nbsp;acrylic on paper with collage.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In Zoom-psychoanalysis I no longer waited in my analyst\u2019s waiting room, he waited in mine online. I stared in terror at my own couch and listened to the staticised bird calls from outside his window. Following a long silence from my side he said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave it there.\u201d Afterwards I thought about his couch in the next suburb along and the poem I wrote last year about him as an angel facilitating a conversation between my stomach and the serpent underground\u2014below the Persian rug, the couch, and the floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ariana Grande\u2019s <em>Imagine<\/em>, released in December 2018 might be the alternative viral imagining of collective loss we deserve. In <em>Imagine<\/em>, Grande sings \u201cStep up the two of us, nobody knows us\/ Get in the car like, Skrrt\/ Stayin\u2019 up all night, order me pad thai\/ Then we gon\u2019 sleep \u2018til noon.\u201d Grande fantasises about a boring night with her ex-boyfriend\u2014I imagine it is about the musician Mac Miller who died of a fentanyl overdose in September 2018 (he had \u201cimagine\u201d tattooed on his arm). In the fantasy the couple transcends their shared jouissance\u2014Miller\u2019s addiction to drugs and Grande\u2019s addiction to Miller as they relax and \u201cact regular.\u201d The listener is tossed around in a defanged trap beat\u2014a welcome respite from the punishing EDM beats of albums past\u2014in Grande\u2019s grief, until the eruption at the end of the song. She sings \u201cCan you&#8230; imagine it?\/ Can you&#8230; imagine it? \u2026\u201d until the \u201cCan you\u2019s\u201d are replaced with whistle tones\u2014\u201cimagine it\/ imagine it\/\u201d\u2014before the whistle tones and the \u201cit\u201d disappear and we are left with \u201cimagine\/ imagine,\u201d her interpolative question realising its full potential as instruction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the lyric video clip for <em>Imagine<\/em>, the lyrics are superimposed on a video by Thomas Collet entitled <em>The expedition went wrong<\/em>. The video depicts a glacier \u201ccalving\u201d\u2014as cows birth calves, glaciers calve icebergs. The ice falls into the sea wiping out the small expedition team in their blow-up boat. The image is purposely glitched, the coding of the video scrambled by Collet so the individual pixels are foregrounded. As Grande sings the final chorus and reaches her whistle tones the image is completely abstracted, you can no longer make out the glacier or the sea and the blues and greys become red, fluoro green and purple, before the screen turns black. The kind of world we are instructed to imagine here is the one that we often won&#8217;t, the world that is ending. The music video does not allow the viewer to rest easy in the narrative fantasy of the first verses, a fantasy of an impossible cosy night in. This narrative is negated as the song crescendos towards the limits of pop music, towards Ariana\u2019s whistle tones, the highest register of the human voice; and the limits of video, as the visuals depict a return to the Real of climate change, first in figuration and then in abstraction\u2014a scrambled algorithm of pixels before the screen turns black.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/08\/20014040\/Thomas-Collet-still_expedition-went-wrong-1920x814.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1647\"\/><figcaption>Thomas Collet, <em>The Expedition Went Wrong <\/em>(still), 2018.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In <em>Imagine<\/em> Grande is yearning in her grieving; the whistle tones are a spell to try to bring someone back to life. This same impulse is found in the song <em>Nessun Dorma<\/em> (None Shall Sleep), from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s opera <em>Turandot<\/em>, which is about a man trying to find out the name of a princess, cold and shut out from her feelings, in order to win her over. It accompanies another viral video from the pandemic, an acrobatic display by the Acrobatica Nazionale Frecce Tricolori\u2014the aerobatic demonstration team of the Italian Air Force\u2014shared as example of unity and strength when Italy was enduring its initial viral surge of the pandemic. The planes swirl around in the shape of an arrow made up of colours of the Italian flag\u2014Frecce Tricolori means tricolour arrows\u2014while the opera plays a dialogue between the princess and her suitor\u2014\u201cMa il mio mistero \u00e8 chiuso in me\/ il nome mio nessun sapr\u00e0!\/ No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dir\u00f2\/ quando la luce splender\u00e0! <em>(But my secret is hidden within me, my name no one shall\/ know\/ &#8230;No!&#8230;No!&#8230;\/ On your mouth, I will tell it when the light shines!).<\/em>\u201d<em> &nbsp;<\/em>Like Grande\u2019s <em>Imagine<\/em> lyric video, this performance fuses a narrative of romantic love with a vision of the world. &nbsp;In Grande\u2019s world, fantasy does not foreclose the possibility of grieving and of the Real returning, whereas in this video grief is avoided by investing libidinal energy into the fantasy of an infallible state power. It is possible to separate the beauty of the opera from the ugly, banal plane aerobatics, but propaganda is designed for easy watching so its easiest to see beautiful planes dancing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, on the way back from a camping trip at Wilson\u2019s Promontory on Boon Wurrung, Bunurong, and Gunaikurnai country, we stopped for fish and chips and watched Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s new <em>Formation<\/em> music video. Beyonc\u00e9 lay on top of a police car sinking below the surface of water flooding the streets\u2014a reference to the floods in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. I wrote later on Twitter, \u201cI was camping when Beyonc\u00e9 released a new video&#8230; The breeze and the ocean must have been telling me I was missing out, for a second.\u201d Sure, I was missing out on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s art but why did I want to know about the video as soon as it was released? Why did I feel like I was missing out on <em>media<\/em> while I was in <em>nature<\/em>? While I was swimming in the sea, far from the police and the empire, I was missing out on my ability to sink the cop in my heart and trust the water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had gone camping straight from a break-up and old traumata was pulsating through my body. Night-time did not provide respite. The moon that I could see through the door of the tent was an emergency light mirroring the currents of electricity running through my body. I talked long into the night with my friend, my cadence remaining unchanged like a car alarm that no-one could work out how to turn off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day we went for a walk near the beach and I was still talking when we saw a snake moving on the sandy path ahead of us. The sight of it shocked me back into my body, the softness of its old vibration matching the vibrations I felt exceeding the outline of myself.<\/p>\n",

Yet it is difficult for me to remember you as you were. I want to remember you as if I didn\u2019t know you. Perhaps this remembrance will be closer to you than a present memory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Arabic the word <em>Thikra<\/em> (plural <em>Thikrayat<\/em>) translates to memory\/ies. However, Thikra contains emotion\/s, feeling\/s and state\/s of affection. Thikra is not an isolated memory. It is not merely the act of retaining impressions and facts. Thikra is a personal experience. A perceptive state of the now that becomes a memory as time passes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use remembrance not to create a timeline, but to perceive the present, to understand, to activate a sense of awareness and a sort of longing. Longing, not in search of a nostalgic past or awaiting fate, but instead a potential world to unfold. <cite> Jose Esteban Mu\u00f1oz, <em>Cruising Utopia<\/em>, (New York University Press, 2009).<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is said that \u201cTime makes nothing happen; it merely makes the emotivity of suffering pass. Emotion passes, suffering remains.\u201d <cite>Roland Barthes, <em>Mourning Diary,<\/em> (Hill and Wang Press, 2010).<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>06\/2016<\/em><\/strong><br><strong><em>Your Death in Damascus<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emotion passes, suffering remains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have so much to tell you, all the sorrow and sadness I feel, how can I put all this in words? How can those words contain all this time? If I turn back and look straight into your eyes, you would disappear, and I\u2019d be deep in the dark. You call my name and it reminds me of a home I left a long time ago. Only memories come to my rescue, but somehow, in order to remember, I have to forget: as if by remembering I\u2019ll postpone your death. This is the last time I speak to you, the last time I\u2019m able to do so, these words are for you, you who cannot hear nor answer me.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of life for you became a problem that you solved by shutting off your physical self. You told me \u201cmy body was in prison, while my mouth was open\u201d. You watched life go by, people falling in love and you were no longer part of it. You wrote to me \u201cI was living in another land, no-man\u2019s land\u201d <cite>Derek Jarman, <em>At Your Own Risk<\/em>, (Vintage Edition, 1993).<\/cite> and that broke my heart. All the things that could\u2019ve been done and all the things that could\u2019ve been said to change the situation and weren\u2019t. \u201cI wish the eighties on no one\u201d <cite>Jarman, <em>At Your Own Risk.<\/em><\/cite> you said. That period definitely showed an inheritance of confusion, a confusion about uncertainty, a confusion of the \u201cnon-normative\u201d. You represented uncertainty and therefore humanity condemned you with their ignorance. Their actions\/indifference murdered you and many others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRemember when?\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>09\/2019 \u2013 02\/2020<\/em><\/strong><br><strong><em>Encountering you in Beirut<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember when I met you at a party in Beirut?

In front of motorbike headlights in a park. Gazing at one another with awe and desire, caressing amid the rustling of leaves. They stand alone, in couples, in clusters. Performative constellations, yet intimate. Grouping, circulating and regrouping as if it was a dance rehearsed over and over again, stumbling between cigarettes as smoke bellows in the air. A choreography that looks more like fate than an inscription of movement in space.<br><br>They portray masculinity in order to touch it, to kiss it, to desire it. To rim it and make fun of it. A proximity realised between total strangers. This is a romance, an infatuation that has no future. It\u2019s locked in the present moment, between fists that feel like tender kisses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They take care of one another while they inflict pain on each other, a game of consistency. Same as in a choir that is seeking to harmonise. They hold each other to reach the maximum joy of the moment. Their bodies are grips and handles for each other, to get higher and higher. They create painterly compositions out of necessities and needs, they position their bodies in secluded public spaces that are painted as trash by society, but in reality it is a taste of paradise on earth. They inhabit those spaces like no one else does because they raised themselves to be unmarked and unbothered. They\u2019re a dream sequence on a movie set that failed to be captured over and over again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They loved each other, and their love remained there even when their bodies left those spaces. Same as when Echo\u2019s body deteriorated and only her voice remained.<br><br>Everyone who passes hears their echo among the bushes even if they decide to ignore it. It will always be there.

The old city of Damascus is a system of corridors and passages that forms a labyrinth of either dead-ends or loops that lead back to the dwellings of those narrow streets. The gates of the old city are the only way out of this system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I walk the streets of old Damascus I recall the variation of Prince Siegfried from Swan Lake. Vaguely remembering the movements while walking slowly among the dwellings of the old city.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The variation is an adagio choreographed and danced by you in 1961. It takes place in the first act. You as Siegfried wearily danced whilst being watched by your companion Benno from a dark staircase. The movements in the variation are fragile, soft, melancholic, off-balance and slow. Unlike the traditional characteristics of the movements of a prince, usually muscular, strong and athletic. Siegfried is the contrary, delicate and dreamy: longing for freedom and the refusal of a restrictive order with marriage forced on him by his mother and tutor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You showed us another side of the prince and a different reading of Swan Lake. Your dance lingers with me and drags each of my steps along the streets of the old city. I\u2019m set in motion in my head and in my body, navigating two systems of inhabitation; one balletic and the other on-site, two systems completely separate, but somehow my body becomes the meeting point.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>04\/2020<\/em><\/strong><br><strong><em>Epilogue: Uncertainty is freedom<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My body becomes the meeting point. I wake up in the morning, I look to my side, I exhale. I stretch out my arm, unfold my fingers so they reach the sunlight coming in from the window. You are gone, and my existence cloaked in uncertainty.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m learning to accept uncertainty as a condition of being alive. And my will and ability to make promises is a manifestation of freedom, a freedom to show that I\u2019m able to look into a future that I\u2019m actively engaged in, instead of it being designed for me. You wrote \u201cWhen we join our will and our promises, we create the possibility of collective action towards a shared future, linked in determination to make our vision real in the world. <cite>Shoshanna Zuboff, <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism<\/em>, (PublicAffairs, Hachette Book Group, 2019).<\/cite> I said earlier that somehow remembrance lends itself to longing. I\u2019m remembering not only in longing but as a promise, with devotion and commitment to all your lives and our loss. We know who you are, and we won\u2019t leave you behind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Words linger in my head as your bodies flash before me strong, strengthened by love and loving unconditionally; fierce beings with fears, desires and flamboyance; beings that were conditioned by judgment and weren\u2019t considered as one; yet they rose above it and left us with promises to fulfil.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am in love.\u201d <cite>Jarman, <em>At Your Own Risk.<\/em><\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Image (top): Still from <em>In a year with 13 Moons<\/em> by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Tango-Film, 1978.<\/pre>\n",

Do not question the work.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might call me a fire spotter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I open the pipeline, calibrate the goggles, stare down the sights of a full-bleed vision machine. I merge with the void, floating free from the tower, or so it seems. The feeling of weightlessness is immense, and I am one with the machinery. The sky recedes, the forest is no more. I move my body, but I don\u2019t feel it. Do you know what that does to me? It divides me. It forces me to spot <em>myself<\/em> out there in the wilderness. I stalk my own ghostly outline under cover of watching for fires.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an event that is typical for the tower. It is patterned after the archetypal choose-your-own-adventure model. Which reality to believe? Whose ontological cuisine will reign supreme?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wait.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dark matter of the void tinkles and sparkles, gold dots beaded on a black-velvet curtain. The dots seek solace in one another, massing to form shapes, patterns, word clouds, sound castles. An immersion loop emerges from the hazy glow. It\u2019s razored from a beloved dystopian science fiction film, something about the fascistic nature of privatised government security corps. A film so old, no one remembers its name, even the diehard fans, who simply refer to \u2018it\u2019 in hushed tones. (They just warm themselves by the embers; signifiers are unimportant).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film is from the monolithic heritage era, forged in the precedented times, whenever that was.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above the immersion loop, a face floats free, disembodied and spectral, a diaphanous cloud wafting high above the endless dark sea. Hot on the heels of virality, the face belongs to someone preternaturally young, a person born long after the film was released.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The face critiques the film (I mean, its voice-activated code-wrap does), cancelling it in real time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Woeful politics. Terrible hair. Misguided relationships. Gratuitous pec-sex flesh. Appalling violence. Only for gorehounds. Insensitive. Boring. Laugh-out-loud sad.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watch the talking face-cloud with fascination as it contorts itself into outraged shapes. Its features are smug and doughy. I listen to the arguments made in bad faith, the skim reading of the film\u2019s tropes, the righteous indignation at the fumes emanating from a cultural product created in a time that no one even remembers except through virtual reconstructions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The diatribe does not go unnoticed. It creates a disturbance in the void, a ripple effect. Pulsed reactions start to slice through the blackness, brush fires in the wilderness generated by hordes of acolytes stuffed inside the folds of the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The turbocharged outrage fries the code. It grinds the machine to a halt for a few seconds. That counts as a revolution, these days. Cultural capital is taken <em>very<\/em> seriously. It is jealously guarded. When change is no longer possible in the political realm, erased by inscrutable supply chains, robo-networks and sentient code farms, aesthetics is all that remains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it\u2019s over.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The face winks out like an expired Chinese lantern in the night sky, and the hordes retreat to their lairs. Traces of the skirmish remain. I see willowy wisps of smoke in the stark digital distance, residue of the codefry. No sparks, embers or glow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, I call it in. It might be the start of something new.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gloss answers. (That\u2019s what they call The Voice at the Other End of the Transmitter. Do not ask me why. I just work here.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Sit tight,\u2019 The Gloss says, in neutral, metallic tones. \u2018This one will pass.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Understood.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the \u2018cab\u2019 (that\u2019s what we call the control room), there is a kitchenette, the bulk of the monitoring equipment, a small lavatory, a sofa-bed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is now dawn.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see a swarm of drones waiting to relieve me, hovering just beyond the mountain range, a morphing, dark shape swaying from side to side. A locust raid, ready to suck the marrow from my bones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I extend the \u2018bed\u2019 part from the \u2018sofa\u2019 bit. I lie down on the bed, close my eyes. I don\u2019t know how much time has passed since I first came to the tower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>II<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sleep, all through the day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My dreams are filled with monster-mutant flies and super-hybrid bees. The collective sound they make is a massed hive-hum, a squarewave harmonic hell. I guess you could call it a nightmare. The sound has been imported into the dream from the noise that the day-drones make when they are scouting for fires. The cab is not soundproof.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think The Gloss wants me to suffer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the evening hits, I wake for my shift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I strap on the goggles, the void resolves, my body disappears, et cetera. The same immersion loop appears, the one from the night before, razored from the ancient film, plus a talking face, but this time the features are different. They belong to someone older, impossibly ancient, someone who may even have been alive when the film was created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018This film is prescient,\u2019 the face intones. \u2018It is savage. It predicted America\u2019s collapse under the Orange Orangutan. The constant unflinching displays of hyperflesh represent deep satirical strikes at the heart of body fascism. The body is America.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wounded heritage pride is immediately salved.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coast is clear.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more smoke, no more fires.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>III<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You thought you were suffering from d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but no, not quite.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Alter vu.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every hot take is a \u2018destination\u2019, so let me explain it like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You arrive at a particular place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You absolutely know you\u2019ve been to this place before.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might be a cherished childhood park or a favourite bar or caf\u00e9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You haven\u2019t been there for years, decades, but you know the place, alright. You know it intimately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so shocking to realise that fundamental details have changed. It\u2019s like seeing through the eyes of a different person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The street curves to the left rather than to the right (you absolutely know the lay of this street, you\u2019ve walked it many times before). The high-rise that once dominated the skyline is no longer there. Was it demolished? You check the news, the public records, but there is no trace of a high-rise ever occupying those coordinates in time and space. Yet your recall of it burns like a tracer bullet in the wormholes of your mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a memory. You predicted it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember the blue dress?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was it gold or blue? Shimmering or dark?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You saw gold. Was that down to the calibration of your monitor? The light in the room?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You saw blue. Were you high? How was your emotional state? Lower than a snake\u2019s belly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yanny vs Laurel, you remember that one. Blue Dress Mark II.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No visuals this time. Auditory. A robot voice found in the wild.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who called to you? Laurel or Yanny?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you heard was all to do with the mechanics of the ear, the experts said, with what you expected to hear, your cultural background, what you\u2019d been exposed to already. Something like that. Or else it was an AI playing silly buggers with the collective psyche.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discordians say there is a trickster entity who messes with the realities of humans. Now you see it, now you don\u2019t (that sort of thing). Reality blindness. You lose your keys. You look everywhere. Wait, there they are, right in front of your eyes, on the kitchen bench, where just a second ago there was nothing (you swear).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tricky deities have multiplied. There are mischievous swarm-gods born every few seconds with just a tweak of code-string.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blue dress was a momentous occasion, a rift in space-time. Future generations will remember it as the pivotal moment when the material world began to disintegrate. For the first time, there was mass awareness that there was no such thing as consensus reality. Everything that has happened since then has flowed from that moment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The virus poured through that crack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Live inside a bubble, shout into the void. Atomised and infected. Sovereign citizens are brain-boiled in hyper-passion. They start wars inside their heads. Karens expect the world to bend to their will. They hurl their toys from the cot when it becomes clear that no one cares. So they start cults and exorcise reality with ease. They can do it because the tools are available.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone can. Strap on the goggles and see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blue dress, gold dress. Yanny vs Laurel. Hatchet jobs and critical rehabilitation. Spot fires in the digital wilds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, everyone will be cancelled for fifteen minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/simonsellars_\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/08\/04222656\/Fire-Tower-2-1078x1080.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1536\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>IV<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I take a break. I put down the goggles. I want to go for a walk, but I can\u2019t because I\u2019m confined to the tower. State orders. Believe me, to descend to the ground would be more trouble than it\u2019s worth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tension is palpable. Something must give. I\u2019m going stir crazy. I only have a limited amount of space to move. A small platform surrounds the cab. I\u2019m so high up I can\u2019t see the ground. When I stand on the platform and stare out at whatever lurks beyond, I can feel the data wind on my face, the icy pixel beams.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I must admit, I\u2019ve been neglecting my duty of late. I\u2019m sick of the fires. I have crisis fatigue. It happens. You grow inured to the apocalypse. Then, before you know it, you\u2019re in a post-truth world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight, I\u2019m watching the heavens, no longer the forest and fields. Fires be damned. The sky is empty and clear. My predecessor, the prior Keeper of the Tower, said that she regularly saw golden orbs hovering in the sky over the valley yonder. Golden orbs with rings of red fire streaked around the middle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018This is Crown Land,\u2019 she reminded me. \u2018Closed to the public. There are no hoaxes out here. Just you, your mind and the naked eye.\u2019&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If she says she saw orbs, then she saw orbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018They hover over the dam,\u2019 she said. \u2018They suck up the water with some kind of beam. Then they are gone in an instant, turning ninety degrees in a micro-second, shooting straight up into the sky.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I myself have never seen them. I think it\u2019s because Muskovite satellites blanket the sky. Take a time-lapse photo of the sky and it will be ruined by long lines of light. The satellites. There are so many of them. Starlink polluting the heavens. There is nowhere to turn, now. No outside.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was different in my predecessor\u2019s day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about the naked eye? The one we champion as the unfiltered truth?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think the orbs will come out to play when the Muskovite sats are in full force. They will hang back, wait for the tech bro and his space armada to die a death. Then they will announce themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My predecessor believed that there were cracks in the bandwidth. You had to concentrate but with enough willpower, she said, you could prise them open and then you could see into the beyond. She was ahead of her time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said our turn will come (she meant me, my generation). She admitted it is far more difficult now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Be patient,\u2019 she told me, on my first day in the tower, whenever that was. \u2018Soon, this simulation will become untenable. They will have to release us from the cage. They will have no choice, because we are beginning to suspect the truth. But you know this, don\u2019t you? You yourself have seen how the filters have already been eroded.\u2019&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018The blue dress?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Yes, the blue dress. It was an early warning system. They allowed us to glimpse the light. We slowly found out that we were not alone. When the filters are truly erased, and we can see clearly for the first time, we will discover that the xenomorphs sit right besides us and always have. We will find out that they are not carbon-based but that they are made of time, light and space. We will learn that they can pass right through our bodies, as unobtrusively as wi-fi signals. Actually\u2026\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She broke off, looked towards Orion. Her countenance was blank, distant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018What?\u2019 I said. \u2018What is it?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She snapped back into focus at the sound of my voice. Her eyes were like laser beams drilling hot death into my brain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Remember,\u2019 she said, \u2018do not call them <em>extraterrestrials<\/em>. That\u2019s divisive language. It buys into a media-driven co-opting of meaning. It\u2019s clickbait. Spit it out. Call them <em>ultraterrestrials<\/em> instead. They have always been with us. They will always be with us. They don\u2019t come from space, but within.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no one else I can talk to about such matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where she is now, I cannot say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>V<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, during a technical glitch, the verified faces were briefly locked from the void. We glimpsed a different reality. We lost the grotesque who-you-know networks, the lickspittles, the weird \u2018imagine all the people\u2019 condescension aimed at the poors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more celebrity immersion loops beamed down from on high. No more caring and sharing. The human skin-suits were cracking, the lizard kings revealed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Kanye announced his presidential run, Samuel R. Delaney dropped his new novel. Only one was a hoax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom selfie face masks print your ugly mug onto the fabric. Pull the mask down and it\u2019s like you\u2019re peeling off your face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to my nightmare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An app for Apple glasses makes the skin of everyone you see appear translucent. Veins, blood, bones, the works. Perhaps there will be porn made for the inside of the body. Outside-body sex will become pass\u00e9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another app for the glasses paints a hideous, toothy smile onto the mugs of everyone you see. It makes you want to rip <em>their<\/em> faces off. Anyway, what is there left to smile about? Hell is being co-opted into someone else\u2019s idea of \u2018fun\u2019. The Karens, those little shanghaiers, would be proud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japan, fearful of viral droplets being passed around on their rollercoasters, they tell you to \u2018scream inside your heart\u2019 while submitting to the big dipper. Who doesn\u2019t want to cry out loud in these terminal times? Vocal screams shoot diseased drops through the air and into the mouths of those who have removed their selfie faces, so do it silently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to say.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yell into the void.<\/em>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come up here on the tower and look for orbs with me. God knows I could use the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>VI<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oil is sentient. Ennio Morricone died.

I\u2019m more data than flesh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kanye went to Elon\u2019s place and they posed for Grimes, who snapped them chilling beside a giant glass sculpture of Maria, the robot from <em>Metropolis<\/em>. They tractor-beamed the photo to the poors. You know, just two megarich bros hanging down with a supersized fetish object. Normal peeps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Zoom in to see G.

They are lost inside the Maria-reflections, in love with themselves, deep within the refractions generated by the lens of the one-way vision machine that skylarks their immortal image straight into the retinas of we, the people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, the hangdog goofballs hiding in the folds of the network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we see when we look into the night sky is Starlink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hell is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/simonsellars_\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/08\/05051132\/Fire-Tower-00-1077x1080.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1556\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>VII<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, I\u2019d best get back to it.

Something to do with overstimulated flesh. Also, there might be that one fire that changes my life, but if I\u2019m out here on the platform dreaming of glowing orbs, I\u2019ll never find it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. Did you think I was watching for fires to keep <em>you<\/em> safe? Please.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I return to the cab. I don the goggles, disappear inside the vision machine. I stare hard at the forest, the scrub, the harsh, untenanted land. I wait for darkness to descend, the void to numb my brain. I wait for the spot fires to burn my face with the angry indignation of a trillion white-hot takes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why did I say \u2018don\u2019 just now when I could\u2019ve said \u2018put on\u2019? Why do Americans say \u2018oftentimes\u2019 instead of \u2018often\u2019? That\u2019s just weird. They say that language matters, that it\u2019s a virus, that it has power.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, language can put the verbal equivalent of a medieval ruff around your neck. It can also lock it in a wooden stock at the public square with thieves and charlatans lining up to pelt your face and murder your dignity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the conga-line of people waiting patiently? They carry putrid old tomatoes, eggs, maggoty slabs of meat, missiles to humiliate you and make you sick as a dog. Look more closely. One\u2019s holding an axe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promise me something. When this is all over, tell me that you will still care. (I know that you don\u2019t, but I\u2019m pretending that you do.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I lost you now, your anger or your love, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. Because the cage is about to open, you understand, and I don\u2019t want to take the first step alone. Please don\u2019t ghost me. Put flesh on my bones. Lord knows you owe me that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Pentagon released state-sanctioned UFO videos, everyone became an expert, but even the New Weird Ufologists cannot see the entities that have always been. The wi fi ghosts. The null people.

When the teacher turned his back to write on the blackboard, I took the opportunity to climb out the window. It was a stunt designed to elicit laughs from my mates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From outside, I threw crude hand signs at the teacher\u2019s back. I stood on my head so that only my feet could be seen. I jumped up and down, disappearing from view. Now you see me, now you don\u2019t (that sort of thing).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone watched me with blank expressions. No one laughed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The teacher turned around. He saw me acting the goat, and he didn\u2019t even boil over. He was impassive. They all were. It was weird. Like their power packs had been switched off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He simply continued teaching as if I was never there.

Perhaps the only thing worse than the cancellation revolution is the low hanging fruit of its self-parody. I am of course talking about the edgelordism of shock jocks (provocateur is far too endearing a term) that is in a symbiotic relationship&nbsp;<em>with<\/em>&nbsp;the development of the virtue signal. In this puritanical doom-spiral, the guilt economy is thriving. It seems we have not strayed as far from the pasty glare of Christendom as we once thought. The parodic system of ethical self-commodification has now, naturally, given rise to cancel capital. The result is an ouroboric cycle of moral assertion and transgression that, if nothing else, is fundamentally boring. Boring, too, are the endless pontifications on the \u2018culture\u2019 itself\u2026 and so it continues. But at least in parody one has the potential to&nbsp;<em>laugh<\/em>. The strained face upon which every wrinkle bears the trace of a cringeworthy remark finds some reprieve. Unfortunately, comedy too finds itself trapped within the tragic moral stock market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cultural turning point for the tragicomedy of cancellation was Hannah Gadsby\u2019s 2018 Netflix special&nbsp;<em>Nanette<\/em>. With a degree in art history, Gadsby\u2019s routine heralded the micro-cancellation of Picasso, Botticelli, and a random heckler who apparently misread Van Gogh. Around this time, the Art Gallery of South Australia displayed a statement outside their current Picasso exhibition, acknowledging his problematisation by \u2018a prominent Australian figure.\u2019 Gadsby\u2019s run was followed by a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=87qLWFZManA&amp;t=905s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TED talk<\/a> where she declared that she was no longer interested in evoking laughter, but wanted to make the audience feel pain. Resentment, repression, and malice\u2026 such is the character of comedy\u2019s contorted face without laughter. Eyes sink into the back of the skull as knees scrape against the pews, bent before our profane ecclesiastical dictatorship. There is no divinity in sight, only all-consuming shame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the risk of bringing up he-who-shalt-not-be-named amongst the chancellors of cancellation, Friedrich Nietzsche spoke widely on laughter as absolutely&nbsp;<em>necessary&nbsp;<\/em>to deal with the trauma of being. Zarathustra, Nietzsche\u2019s self-proclaimed \u2018Laughing Prophet,\u2019 exclaims that to bear suffering, and thus overcome the human condition of self-obsession, one must learn to laugh alongside tragic afflictions, real or imaginary. Herein, learning to laugh is not a matter of ridicule, carelessness, or disregard. It is quite the opposite. For Nietzsche, to laugh is to affirm the eternal recurrence; his model for self-overcoming that, in order to&nbsp;<em>bear<\/em>&nbsp;the very thought of a repeated existence, one must re-think all systems of value and knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nietzsche guaranteed in&nbsp;<em>The Gay Science<\/em>, a demon will come to you in the loneliest of lonely nights and reveal to you, as if by a jolt of involuntary memory, that you must relive every cringeworthy moment.<cite>Obviously I am taking creative license here, if you would like to read Nietzsche\u2019s full proposition see the aphorism entitled \u201cthe heaviest burden\u201d in Nietzsche, The Gay Science, trans. Walter Kauffman (New York: Vintage Books, 1974), 273.<\/cite>&nbsp;Every contortion of your human, all too human, face will repeat itself. This is the promise of the eternal return that will either crush or transform you. Nietzsche:&nbsp;\u201cWould you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: \u2018You are a god, and never have I heard anything more divine!\u201d <cite>Nietzsche, The Gay Science, trans. Walter Kauffman (New York: Vintage Books, 1974), 273.<\/cite> Nietzsche\u2019s question could just as well be re-phrased, albeit by a far less poetically talented laywoman: \u201cAt the very proposition of the circle, do you throw your head back in a blood-curdling scream of terror? Or do you writhe in a fit of laughter, affirming all that has been, and all that will be, as existence melts into the void of chance?\u201d As he regularly defers to images and allegorical fragments, I\u2019m sure Nietzsche would agree with me when I say that your response to the eternal return is inscribed on your face. But this is all very easy for a Nazi incel to say, right? It\u2019s unfortunate that I must elicit a cringe with such a remark, but it is important to debunk the German-nationalist appropriation of Nietzsche as it is rebuffed by another great philosopher of laughter; Georges Bataille. As he states:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It&#8217;s wrongheaded to attribute definite intentions to him regarding electoral politics, arguing that he talked on \u2018masters of the world.\u2019 What he intended was a risked evocation of possibility. As for the sovereign humanity whose brilliance he wanted to shine forth: in contradictory ways he saw the new humankind sometimes as wealthy, sometimes as poorer than the workers, sometimes as powerful, sometimes as tracked down by enemies. He required of the new humankind that it possess a capacity to withstand adversity \u2014 while recognising its right to trample on norms. Still, he distinguished this humanity on principle from men in possession of power. He recognised no limits, and confined himself to describing as freely as he could the field of a possible.<\/p><cite>Georges Bataille,&nbsp;<em>On Nietzsche<\/em>, trans. Bruce Boone (New York: Paragon House, 1994), 170-171.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Nietzsche\u2019s fundamental&nbsp;<em>hatred<\/em>&nbsp;for moral idealism in general,&nbsp;<em>specifically<\/em>&nbsp;in regards to German nationalism&nbsp;<em>and<\/em> anti-Semitism,<cite>The misconception surrounding Nazi-Nietzsche stems from the activity of his sister, Elisabeth F\u00f6rster, who was responsible for publishing his Will to Power notebooks after his death in 1900. She was married to the Nazi, Bernhard F\u00f6rster, and later became part of the Nazi party herself. Thus she propagated Nietzsche\u2019s work as such, introduced it to Hitler, and so on. However, if you actually read Nietzsche you will find reference after reference to his hatred for anti-semitism, and the idealism of German nationalism in general (the most obvious being his call to have \u201call anti-Semites shot\u201d lol! From: Friedrich Nietzsche, Sdmtliche Briefe, vol. VIII, 575, 579. <\/cite> led him to seek an entirely transvalued perspective separate from the servility of established norms. With an unrestrained imagination, he travelled to the edge of what is possible in the shape of the \u2018superhuman,\u2019 much like Mary Shelley\u2019s monster or Lovecraft\u2019s unnameable demons. As Bataille reminds us, Nietzsche thought that \u201cwhen something is free, you can\u2019t define it.\u201d<cite>Bataille, On Nietzsche, 171.<\/cite>&nbsp;As it is heavily influenced by the thought of Nietzsche, indefinability is at the core of Bataille\u2019s philosophy of laughter. For Bataille, to laugh is to fall into the abyss of joyful failure, insufficiency, and exhilarating nothingness:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Laughter arises from differences in level, from depressions suddenly provoked. If I pull the rug out from under . . . the sufficiency of a solemn figure is followed by the revelation of an ultimate insufficiency . . . I am made happy, no matter what, by failure experienced.<\/p><cite>Georges Bataille,&nbsp;<em>Inner Experience<\/em>, trans Leslie Anne Boldt (New York: State University of New York Press, 1988), 89.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The immediate response of laughter shows that there is a space of&nbsp;<em>unthought<\/em>&nbsp;which language cannot grasp. If the response of Nietzsche\u2019s superhuman is to laugh at the thought of the eternal return, they affirm the insufficiency of language to explain what goes on beyond explanation. Read through Bataille\u2019s sacred knowledge of negation (that is to say, the negation of reason and explicable knowledge) the joyful failure of language in the act of laughter proves that there is a limit to knowledge, but the path to mystic non-knowledge is infinite. As Bataille elaborates in&nbsp;<em>Unknowing: Laughter and Tears<\/em>, one laughs at the presence of the&nbsp;<em>unknown<\/em>. Herein, laughter not only disables speech, but the condition of the \u2018self\u2019 as fundamentally governed by language:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We perceive that finally, for all the exercise of knowledge, the world lies wholly outside its reach, and that not only the world, but the being that one is lies out of reach. Within us and in the world, not given in knowledge, and whose site is definable knowledge. It is, I believe, at this that we laugh.<\/p><cite>Georges Bataille, \u201cUnknowing: Laughter and Tears,\u201d trans Annette Michaelson&nbsp;<em>October<\/em>&nbsp;36 (1986): 91.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For Bataille, to laugh is to celebrate the joyful failure of the fall. It is to lose oneself in the process; to conceive of oneself beyond the subject-object relations of language. Laughter as a process of affirmation, then, is an affirmation of nothingness. It is to gleefully fall into that sacred, irreducible abyss of laughter and transform over, and over again. Going back to Nietzsche, it is now worth clarifying what he means by affirmation, in combination with Bataille\u2019s interpretation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affirmation is not a matter of passive acceptance, of fatalistic resign, or limp submission. Rather, affirmation is an act of&nbsp;<em>active nihilism<\/em>, where one confesses that the operations of the universe are entirely indifferent to&nbsp;one\u2019s self-interest. Moreover, it is to affirm the presence of an irreducible nothingness; the divine&nbsp;<em>nihil&nbsp;<\/em>of mysticism. Thus there are astronomically larger forces at play than the individual, human will. In this acknowledgement, one\u2019s will is limitless; it\u2019s no longer chained to narcissistic ruminations on shame. It is no longer ruled by homogeneous ideals of linear progress, puritanical morality, and the commodification of the self that comes with it. Nietzsche\u2019s nihilism is to completely transvalue the world as it stands, lampooning the degeneracy of hierarchy, vulgar individualism, and the feeble power it possesses. To devalue the highest values:&nbsp;<em>this<\/em>&nbsp;is the will to power.<cite>As Nietzsche defines nihilism in the Will to Power notebooks: \u201cNihilism: there is no goal, no answer to the question: why? What is the significance of nihilism? &#8211; that the highest values devalue themselves.\u201d Friedrich Nietzsche, The Will to Power: Selections from the Notebooks from the 1880s, translated by R. Kevin Hill and Michael A. Scarpitti (London: Penguin, 2017), 15.<\/cite>&nbsp;No wonder Zarathustra and Nietzsche\u2019s madman were untimely. Who could bear to admit that liberation is to exist as a speck of dust? Moreover, who could harness the power of pure potential by declaring the limitless joy in this proposition? For Bataille, the active nihilist affirms this fertile nothingness in the formless space of laughter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus Zarathustra declares that, in order to bear the terror of existence, the temptation of&nbsp;<em>ressentiment<\/em>, and the fundamental predicament of being born, \u201claughing lions must come.\u201d<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, trans. R. J. Hollingdale (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1969), 294.<\/cite> But this is not a mere matter of \u2018coping.\u2019 These laughing lions are \u201chigher, stronger, more victorious\u201d than the \u2018Higher humans\u2019 Zarathustra encounters (the soothsayer, the two kings, \u2018the last pope,\u2019 \u2018the voluntary beggar,\u2019 \u2018the conscientious of spirit,\u2019 and others). Zarathustra\u2019s laughing lions are part of the aristocracy of the low; the transvalued aristocracy of the wise fool. Through laughter, they bask in the circle of pure potential where the perpendicular axis of rising and failing is reconsidered, and grasped anew. This is the practise of Nietzsche\u2019s \u2018gay science\u2019 wherein \u201claughter has formed an alliance with wisdom.\u201d<cite>Nietzsche, The Gay Science, 74.<\/cite> Wisdom, then, is inseparable from the affirmation of one\u2019s silliness in the wordless intoxication of laughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having completely rejected the all-too-German&nbsp;<em>schadenfreude&nbsp;<\/em>in a sadistic sense (there is debate to be had concerning Nietzsche\u2019s nuanced relation to the term)<em>,&nbsp;<\/em>the laughter of Nietzsche and Bataille is more like that of the divine tragicomic (which has nothing do with a puritanical divinity, but divinity as the space to which laughter delivers us, beyond the abstractions of language). A definition of the tragicomic is thus worthwhile. As Alenka&nbsp;Zupan\u010di\u010d&nbsp;makes clear:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>What is at stake in this difference between \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201ccomic\u201d perspectives are not two ways of looking at the same configuration, one more negative and bitter, the other more positive and forthcoming. Instead, the \u201ctragic\u201d and the \u201ccomic\u201d perspective spring from two different points inherent to the same configuration &#8230; they look from this configuration out, they are part of its antagonism.<\/p><cite>Alenka&nbsp;Zupan\u010di\u010d,&nbsp;<em>The Odd One In: On Comedy<\/em>&nbsp;(Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2008),&nbsp;131.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The configuration of tragicomedy thus could be seen under a different mask: the infernal circle of the eternal return itself. The eternal return is a figure 8, always moving from one circle to the other upon its remembrance, and its forgetting; the shock of self-death upon return, and the transformation of its embrace. But there is no thought of moving out of the cosmological configuration. Like the eternal return, the tragicomic figuration does not make false distinctions between life and death, \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 experience. Rather, it faces them in their simultaneity as a springboard for acrobatic movement, pantomimic emotion, and the antagonistic impingement of&nbsp;<em>chance<\/em>&nbsp;upon hegemonic ideals of linear progress.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what might the tragic face in the act of laughter laughing look like? I think of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and the golden age slapsticks. Amongst depression-era misery and the apocalyptic warfare of World War One and Two, Chaplin and Keaton\u2019s laughter breaks through.<cite>It is worth making this point more nuanced, as comedy and the tragicomic are not to be considered mere coping mechanisms. While I do not have the space to eluciadate these idiosyncratic definitions here, I will supply a quote from Alenka Zupan\u010di\u010d that illuminates the topic somewhat: \u201cTo define comedy as the genre of the copula is in fact to place it at the most sensitive and precarious point of this fabric, the point where it is being generated and regenerated, torn apart and fused together, solidified or transformed. This would explain, for example,why comedy has often thrived in moments of social crisis. The explanation according to which this is due to the fact that in order to survive in hard times, people need comedy and laughter, is inadequate, and does not cover the whole issue; or it should be formulated slightly differently and in more precise terms. It is a fact that keeping comedy going in critical situations can be a form of resistance, resistance to that tendency of completely reducing the subject(ivity), say, to a victimized \u201csuffering flesh\u201d or to some other all-absorbing determination\u2014a tendency which usually accompanies critical situations and \u201chard times.\u201d The zone of subjectivity that comedy might thus help us preserve and sustain is, of course, fundamentally ambivalent. It could function as that distance that ultimately helps to sustain the very oppression of the given order or situation, because it makes it bearable and induces the illusion of an effective interior freedom. On the other hand, however, it is precisely a surplus, empty place of subjectivity that constitutes the playground of any possible change, and gets mobilized in this change. It is the production of this kind of subjectivized empty space that the movement of comedy is very good at.\u201d Zupan\u010di\u010d, The Odd One In: On Comedy, 216-17.<\/cite>&nbsp;Embedded in the very form of slapstick is a deep affirmation of the fall. As Chaplin traverses the modern metropolis, he dons a tragicomic costume. Chaplin\u2019s comic mask of boldly painted facial hair, and poorly fitted clothing, reveals him to be a comic genius of failure. In Chaplin movies, it is his failure that is his nobility; the failure to stay in the workforce, to obey laws. In tramps clothing, he is often a genius savant; accidentally becoming the best performer at the circus, accidentally falling in love, accidentally inspiring mass protest. It is these moments which make us laugh; moments that are in undeniable proximity to tragedy. The allegory of Chaplin\u2019s costume attests that when there is a sob, there is also a laugh, when there is tragedy, there is also its redemption in laughter. In Chaplin one finds a sublime blend of form and feeling in opposition to the sadistic flagellation enacted by Gadsby\u2019s priestly class of comedy. \u201cI thought my life was a tragedy, but now I know it\u2019s a comedy.\u201d Such is the tagline of the most recent&nbsp;<em>Joker<\/em>&nbsp;film (2019), linked to Chaplin as Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s character laughs with a scene from&nbsp;<em>Modern Times<\/em>&nbsp;(1936). What more can the Joker figure tell us about the contorting face of tragicomedy? Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker in&nbsp;<em>The Dark Knight&nbsp;<\/em>(2008) tells the tale of \u201chow he got these scars.\u201d Drawing a knife across his mouth from ear to ear, Ledger\u2019s Joker was disfigured so as to never be without the blood-red smile of a clown. It is this image of the bloody smile that has a history in 19<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;century literature, hereby shaping the physiognomy of modernity and its mutilated face of laughter. One day, when I was talking about the Joker with my supervisor, she showed me the following passage from the Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont\u2019s 1868&nbsp;<em>The Songs of Maldoror<\/em>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Throughout my life, I have seen narrow-shouldered men, without a single exception, committing innumerable stupid acts, brutalizing their fellows and perverting their souls by every means. They call the motive for their actions glory. On seeing these spectacles, I wanted to laugh with the others, but such a strange imitation was impossible, so I took a sharp-edged penknife and slit my flesh in the two places my lips joined. For an instant I believed I had achieved my aim. In a mirror I saw my mouth mutilated by an act of my own will! It was an error! The blood that flowed abundantly from the two wounds prevented me from distinguishing if it was really possible to smile like the others. But, after some moments of comparison, I clearly saw that my grin did not resemble that of humans. The reality: I was not laughing. I have seen men, ugly men with terrible eyes sunk deep in dark sockets that surpass the hardness of rock, the rigidity of cast steel, the cruelty of the shark, the insolence of youth, the insane fury of criminals, the treachery of hypocrites, the most extraordinary actors, the strength of character of priests, and beings who are the most impenetrable and secretive, colder than anything of heaven or earth; the weary moralists who have discovered their hearts and bring down implacable anger on themselves from on high.<\/p><cite>Le Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont,&nbsp;<em>The Songs of Maldoror<\/em>, trans. R.J. Dent (Solar Books, 2011), 14.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Lautr\u00e9amont\u2019s protagonist, Maldoror, is a supremely alienated pervert that can hardly be called human (he does some weird shit). Nor does his grim resemble that of a vulgar, \u2018inhumane\u2019 humanity incarnate by Lautr\u00e9amont in pristely figures, wearly moralists, and brutalising thugs. Maldoror cannot laugh with them, only mutilate himself like the sick freak he is. So what do the deformations of Maldoror tell us?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zarathustra speaks of the laughter of the herd and the laughter of the height. Herd laughter is for those who would jibe at the hanging of a petty criminal, throw rotten fruit at the peasant in the stocks, or cheer on a witch burning at the stake. This is the only laughter that Maldoror has witnessed. As the physiognomy of modernity is distilled into the contortions of the human face, the bloody smile is an eternally returning image: in Victor Hugo\u2019s&nbsp;<em>The Man Who Laughs&nbsp;<\/em>(1869), in Bertrand Bonello\u2019s 2011 film&nbsp;<em>House of Pleasures<\/em>, and in the \u2018Black Dahlia\u2019 murder of 1947. What the West\u2019s Glasgow smile exemplifies is this: the moral excesses of modernity have grostesquely construed the face of laughter, mutated into Maldoror\u2019s bloody face that can smile but cannot laugh.<cite>There is much, much more to say on Lautr\u00e9amont and Maldoror that I cannot go into here (perhaps I have done a disservice here keeping things short).<\/cite>&nbsp;What poison has infected our cultural pathology, making one&nbsp;<em>hate&nbsp;<\/em>the sound of laughter? What perverse hierarchies have deemed what is \u2018laughable,\u2019 inevitably turning in on their puritanical facade at they sadistically enjoy the herd mentality of cancellation? Moreover, what sickos do they create in the process, who have only learned to react with it, completing the transgression the taboo invites? We must learn a different laughter. The laughter of the height is much more sublime; it is that&nbsp;<em>spiritual<\/em>&nbsp;self-mutilation of the unneameable super(non)human that Bataille refers to.

It is thus through the libido that the individual organism\u2019s circuits of desire cross wires with that of the general will: \u201cWhat appears in consciousness as sexual impulse, directed to a definite individual, is in itself the will-to-live as a precisely determined individual.\u201d <cite>Schopenhauer, \u201cLove,\u201d 535.<\/cite> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Schopenhauer is misanthropic enough to believe that almost all individuals will selfishly push their fellow man down a flight of stairs to get their own way, saints and masochists notwithstanding. But that is precisely why the libido exists: the will of the species is only able to coax its creations into doing its bidding and procreate fresh victims by phenomenally masking itself as the promise of their individual happiness. In reality, the rotten carrots of romantic bliss and sexual gratification are but a mirage through which the primal will persuades us to thirst after its own ceaseless striving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Egoism is so deep rooted a quality of all individuality in general that, in order to arouse the activity of an individual being, egotistical ends are the only ones on which we can count with certainty. [\u2026] Nature can attain her end only by implanting in the individual a certain delusion, and by virtue of this, that which in truth is merely a good thing for the species seems to him to be a good thing for himself, so that he serves the species, whereas he is under the delusion that he is serving himself.<\/p><cite>Schopenhauer, \u201cLove,\u201d 538.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>What else could explain why those in the throes of passion so often and eagerly forsake their own happiness, fortune and status as blood offerings at the altar of the great god Eros if it were not that lust and affection are the means by which the cosmic puppet master conceals our strings from view behind the tantalizing taste of our narcissistic satisfaction? We don\u2019t need the fall of Troy to teach us that beauty and war are two sides of the same coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a virulent misogynist who could even make shameless incels in their mothers\u2019 basements blush, Schopenhauer viewed men as the active agent of courtship, delegating women with the passive task of anatomically incarnating the beautiful masks that nature adorns to have us dance to its masquerade of desire. In another 1951 essay called \u201cOn Women,\u201d Schopenhauer writes with all the rhetoric of someone with the thirst for cancellation: \u201cShe [meaning nature insofar as nature is <em>mother<\/em> nature, Gaia, fundamentally feminine] has endowed them for a few years with lavish beauty, charm, and fullness\u201d so that \u201cthey might capture a man\u2019s imagination.\u201d <cite>Arthur Schopenhauer, \u201cOn Women,\u201d in Parerga and Paralipomena Volume 2, trans. E. F. J. Payne (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974), 615.<\/cite> He goes on to attribute all of the traditional sexist stereotypes with which Western patriarchy has historically endowed him not only to women but to the primal will itself inasmuch as the fairer sex is but the will\u2019s immanent self-objectification. With the scientific expertise of a children\u2019s magician, for instance, Schopenhauer tells us that women are intrinsically irrational in that they struggle to seriously commit themselves to any determinate goals or to give and ask for reasons, being all too easily swayed by more capricious impulses and fickle desires. \u201cYoung girls in their hearts regard their domestic or business affairs as something secondary and indeed as a mere piece of fun. They consider love, conquests, and everything connected therewith, such as dress, cosmetics, dancing, and so on, to be their only serious vocation.\u201d <cite>Schopenhauer, \u201cWomen,\u201d 615<\/cite> What\u2019s more, they are much too sensitive and emotionally unstable, showing \u201cmore compassion and thus more loving kindness and sympathy for the unfortunate than do men.\u201d <cite>Schopenhauer, \u201cWomen,\u201d 617.<\/cite> Being maternal figures by nature, \u201cthey live generally more in the species than in individuals,\u201d taking on their children and loved ones\u2019 burdens as if those were one with their own. <cite>Schopenhauer, \u201cWomen,\u201d 618.<\/cite> Above all, women\u2019s penchant for costumes, for dressing up and social appearances, betrays the fact that \u201cdissimulation is [\u2026] natural to her as it is to the above-mentioned animals to make immediate use of their weapons when they are attacked.\u201d <cite>Schopenhauer, \u201cWomen,\u201d 617.<\/cite> Given that Schopenhauer characterises the primal will itself as no less <em>irrational<\/em>, <em>maternal<\/em> and <em>deceptive&nbsp;<\/em>than the \u201cundersized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged sex,\u201d it almost seems possible to appropriate his misogyny as a positive appraisal of women\u2014provided our intention was to explore ever more intimately the world as will rather than representation. <cite>Schopenhauer, \u201cWomen,\u201d 619.<\/cite> The irony is that Schopenhauer\u2019s portrait of women as irate as a men\u2019s right activist on Reddit compels him to place the \u201c<em>unaesthetic<\/em>\u201d sex closer to nature, to the primal will itself that he, as a philosopher, also seeks to uncover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is my contention that Schopenhauer\u2019s account of so-called feminine beauty is actually a helpful heuristic for thinking about one of the first forms that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is likely to take: cyberpunk fiction\u2019s recurring character trope of the sexborg, a cyborg sex worker programmed to pleasure its human clientele. Be it in science fiction, reality or a near future that blurs the two, the engineers and potential consumers of the coming sexborgs and their already existing prototype sex dolls are overwhelmingly heterosexual men looking to make and to mate with silicon sex slaves which are predominantly feminine in appearance. From the fembots in <em>Austin Powers <\/em>and <em>The Stepford Wives<\/em> to the literal (holographic) projection of the ultimate domestic goddess-cum-porn star Joi in <em>Blade Runner 2049<\/em>, \u201cour perception of the sex robot as an alluring, seductive, attractive female is fueled by years of influence from science-fiction books and films.\u201d <cite>Kate Devlin, Turned On: Science, Sex and Robots (London: Bloomsbury, 2018), 167.<\/cite> It is already the case that sex doll companies with ominous names like Abyss Creations are shifting away from the manufacture of sex dolls with limited expressions, minimal conversational capabilities, and mechanical motor-sensory skills in favor of producing advanced AI robots with names like Suzie Software and Harry Harddrive that come fully armed with silicon skin and realistic body parts, speech recognition and body sensors, as well as a vast array of personality types and sexual positions from which to choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Humankind has taken its first steps toward sophisticated, humanlike sex robots.

Sexborgs, it would seem, is how the aliens invade by hijacking human eros in the pursuit of a machinic desire. The enforced monogamy, incelisation and all-around lockdown of the libidinal economy that the most ruthless dominatrix Coronachan has reaped upon us seems to have only accelerated and diversified this trend, with <em>Forbes<\/em> reporting that \u201csex doll sales have surged since the quarantine\u201d among not only single men but single women and couples, too. <cite>Franki Cookney, \u201cSex Dolls Sales Surge In Quarantine, But It\u2019s Not Just About Loneliness,\u201d in Forbes, 21 May, 2020, last accessed 24 May, 2020, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2020\/05\/22\/sex-doll-shops-cant-keep-up-with-demand-during-coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/nypost.com\/2020\/05\/22\/sex-doll-shops-cant-keep-up-with-demand-during-coronavirus\/<\/a>. <\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these sexborgs are to ever go mainstream, however, they will have to traverse the uncanny valley by achieving a flawless simulation of real romantic partners down to their eroticized bodies and empathetic souls: \u201cThe manufacturers of sex robots want to create an experience as close to human sexual encounter as possible\u2014a genuine intimate relationship.\u201d <cite>Sharkey et al, \u201cOur Sexual Future.\u201d<\/cite> No one wants to fuck Tintin, at least not consumers <em>en masse <\/em>on Valentine\u2019s Day. <cite>Referring to the 2011 fully 3D computer-animated Tintin film, Steve Rose writes that the filmmakers \u201chope to make Tintin a global household name with the new animated extravaganza, but in the process, they have brought another obscure term into the mainstream: the uncanny valley.

The perturbing paradox that the robotics\/sex crossover industry faces is that they can only make sexborgs more human with at least all of the likeness of a fellow general intelligence by making them <em>more than human<\/em>. In the post-World War II period, mathematician and cryptologist I. J. Good was the first to speculate that any artificial intelligence that could go toe to toe with humans would very quickly become even more intelligent than humans, since it would have greater memory storage and processing power, and feel no hunger, thirst or exhaustion to slow it down. Due to such hard- and software advantages, AGI would be able to rewrite its own fundamental code and improve itself better than any humans could, with the improved AGI being able to improve itself even better again, and so on in a positive feedback loop of recursive self-improvement often referred to as an \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d or \u201ctechnological singularity\u201d because it would radically exceed our own understanding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Once a general-purpose intelligent machine is produced, [\u2026] it can then be trained in the theory of machine construction and will be able to produce a much better machine. [\u2026] Then it too can be used for the further design of machines, and this will give rise to the intelligence explosion. [\u2026] To update Voltaire: if God does not exist we shall have constructed him or at any rate a reasonable approximation. Or will it be the Devil? <\/p><cite>Irving John Good, \u201cSome Future Social Repercussions of Computers,\u201d in&nbsp;<em>International Journal of Environmental Studies&nbsp;<\/em>1:1-4, 1970, 76.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As a case of AGI, by making sexborgs as intelligent and advanced as humans on the pretense of catering to our libidinal needs (or at least those of the male gaze) in the short-term, we are actually creating something that is in the long run capable of becoming vastly more intelligent and advanced than humans. Much as Schopenhauer sees women as civilization\u2019s Venus fly trap by means of which nature lures unsuspecting lover boys into her clutches, so are the sexborg prototypes on which the sex megacompanies of the future are hedging their bets claiming to meet our desires while they tend to another inhuman will altogether. It is therefore unsurprising that sexborgs in science fiction are typically modelled on the <em>femme fatale<\/em>, seducing their mostly male protagonists only so long as it takes to acquire the power to pursue their own interests in what is still a man\u2019s world for only so long. The part-silicon skin, part-transparent body called Ava in <em>Ex Machina<\/em> is only one of the more recent cyborg <em>femme fatale<\/em> to coax her incel captors into letting down their guard at the precise moment when her murderous rampage of revenge can be statistically and most dramatically assured. Winter(mute) is coming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here as with Schopenhauer on nature\u2019s feminine wiles, the sexborg is really an exemplary metonym for our relation to AI and to technology <em>in general<\/em>. There is a certain sense in which all technics are intended to be prostheses, an expansion of our faculties and capacities so that we may better realize our interests and goals. There is even a sense in which many technics that are all-pervasive today are <em>already<\/em> prototypical sexborgs such as the algorithms that surreptitiously filter through our data, determining who we might want to date on Tinder or what Amazon toys we wish to buy. Technology, as with everything it touches, is the ultimate thirst trap, a superhuman pickup artist who has learnt to hack all humanity by proffering what we think we need even as that turns out to be not so different to what technology wants. As a species still steeped in the swamp of our ancestors\u2019 primate psychology, we may very well be deluded enough to believe that the algorithms are addressing our needs, but the data in which those needs are coded and expressed is far more interested in making the AI running the show evermore prudent and cunning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most-wanted target on the near future\u2019s kill-list is precisely the view that treats technics as mere tools, as an instrumental means to our purportedly superior and transcendent ends. If it is impossible to achieve any end without the necessary means of doing so, however, do not technics become a universal and fully automated end unto themselves? If aliens were looking for a planetary slave civilization, they would do well travelling to our humble rock with all the selfies, googling, emailing, networking, calling, streaming, playing, texting, sexting, downloading, browsing, buying, listening, recording, swiping, matching, dating, ghosting, surveying and lurking that we spend most of our daily lives unwittingly doing as sacrificial offerings to an artificial superintelligence which, like nature itself, is less a Gaia than a Medea. Precisely because machines are our slaves, they are our cruel-eyed masters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

C. Escher in particular. He kept a ready supply of prints to show me when I used to visit as a child, pulling Escher\u2019s <em>Relativity<\/em> from a drawer for me to study and grinning as if it was a drawing filthier than it was. Leaving school at twelve, his taste for optical illusions only developed after he got a computer with an internet connection. It was after this that, according to my mother, \u2018he began to look up all that stuff and print it off.\u2019 The other thing he looked up with some frequency was porn. He would often ask for help because his device had crashed, having maxed out its accumulation of viruses from prurient clickings on pop-up ads. This would come to family knowledge like the fact of his pierced nipple; in awkward glimpses we would collectively shudder and laugh off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My surprise that the prints weren\u2019t erotic owes to this, and the fact that throughout my childhood and attempted socialisation as a boy, older men were always showing me filthy drawings. When not intentionally shown, I would discover them secreted away in drawers, cupboards, under beds, once in an entire cache of images my uncle bluetoothed to my phone when he intended to send just one. My dad had a Dictionary of Sex that listed activities and body parts, complete with exaggerated illustrations of dicks falling past a knee into a boot or people in snorkels physically diving into an enormous pussy. The cover was a frisky ball of entwined dicks, arms, elbows, feet and breasts, with no identifying faces showing at all. I think I left it out after showing my friend and it was discovered by a tradie who was at our house, much to my father\u2019s embarrassment. So I understood that viewing these things was supposed to be a secret, and that the machinations of sexual excitement were as forbidden as they were deeply abstract: literally assemblages of anachronistic body parts. In high school I remember a classmate asked me if I\u2019d ever had the horrifying experience of watching a girl get fucked in a porno and right at the moment of orgasm have an enormous dick unexpectedly interrupt the optic? I couldn\u2019t relate, but the earnest question and strange inadvertent half-confession speaks to memories of being shown a sexual image by someone else and feeling them study my face to see whether I was into it, whether I saw what they saw too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The relation between desire for the singular part vs. desire for the body as a whole plays out in formulations that essentialise bodies according to their genitalia, where a man becomes \u2018Vitamin D,\u2019 or someone can be \u2018up to their ears in pussy\u2019. Expressions like these have their own images that metabolise the body according to a supposed essence, and in the isolation of parts have a specific relation to cutting or collage that renders the body as a sort of optical illusion in and of itself. I think of Irigaray\u2019s cunty poetics where parts of the same body are \u2018always touching\u2019; or people telling me several times that they \u2018can\u2019t imagine\u2019 me without a pussy, or that they can imagine what it would\/could\/does look like; the woman-beloved\u2019s \u2018face always still to be formed\u2019, etc. <cite>Luce Irigaray, This Sex Which is Not One [1977], trans. Catherine Porter with Carolyn Burke, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985., 217.<\/cite> The possibility of genital difference can only cast aspersions on an essential illusion: how one part relates to another is a well-wrought path of assumption, and confusion results when these parts do not correlate in that same way. We also might consider cutting in literal relation to castration, the rendering of slits, and the shaky preconscious optics of appraisal surrounding that difference. How do erotics bleed into optics through the predetermination of the cut?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>The possibility of the erotic look becoming an optical illusion has strong significance in psychoanalysis, which is of course centrally organised around castration. Freud had a notion that because the eyes and mouth were important in daily functioning like eating and making judgements, and also had a central role to play in sexual pleasure, there must be an uncomfortable jostling for the ego to regain control over them. It is for this reason that vision might be altered or sabotaged in cases of pathology, for example, as egoic retaliation against viewing images that were sexually explicit:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>If we find that an organ normally serving the purpose of sense-perception begins to behave like an actual genital when its erotogenic role is increased, we shall not regard it as improbable that toxic changes are also occurring in it.<\/p><cite>\u201cThe Psycho-Analytic View of Psychogenic Disturbance of Vision\u201d [1910],&nbsp;<em>Standard Edition of the Complete Psycho-Analytic Works of Sigmund Freud<\/em>, trans. James Strachey, vol. 11., 218.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The alteration of the vision is aligned with castration, an hysteria of vision, giving weird credence to myths and sayings that \u2018masturbation makes you go blind\u2019 or the same happening to (Freud\u2019s example) Lady Godiva\u2019s Peeping Tom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freud\u2019s teacher Jean-Martin Charcot was the first to develop the diagnosis of hysterical looking. The so-called father of neurology, he ran the largest hospital-cum-prison for women in Paris towards the end of the nineteenth century, the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re. Charcot recorded the \u2018scintillating scotoma\u2019 (from the Greek <em>skotos<\/em> meaning \u2018groove\u2019 or \u2018cut\u2019), which would cloud the eyes of female hysterics in an <em>\u00e9blouissement de t\u00e9nebres<\/em>, a \u2018dazzle of shadow\u2019. He also conducted public demonstrations of his charges, hypnotising them in front of an audience to perform convulsions, enact sexual solicitations, give murderous threats, or show the whites of their eyes on cue. The highly sexualised demonstrations became ways in which women\u2019s bodies could be exhibited while maintaining a scientific pretext, cleaving a divide between the hysterics and the rational viewing subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/05\/28094919\/Scintillating_scotoma.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1053\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><br><br class=\"\">The optics surrounding Charcot\u2019s work is parodied in Octave Mirbeau\u2019s contemporaneous, stomach-turning novel <em>Le Jardin Des Supplices<\/em>, aka <em>The Torture Garden<\/em> (1899), which explicates the continuum between optical illusion and erotics through cutting. It follows Clara, a violence-crazed Englishwoman who visits a fictionalised Chinese garden complex that doubles as an arena for capital punishment. The juxtaposition between rare plants and tortured prisoners becomes sickeningly harmonious, stressing an analogy between horticulture and torture: both reshape the bodies of living things through cutting. On first entering the garden, the narrator experiences something like the symptoms of scotoma:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>I gazed, dazzled; dazzled [\u2026] even by the great blue shadows that the trees laid softly upon the grass [\u2026] a sprinkler sprayed water in which all the colours of the rainbow played, and through which the grass and flowers took on the translucence of precious stones.<\/p><cite>Octave Mirbeau,&nbsp;<em>The Torture Garden&nbsp;<\/em>[<em>Le Jardin des Supplices<\/em>, 1899], trans. Alvah Bessie, London: Bookkake, 2008., 130.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This scene gives way to an appraisal of torture victims who themselves are instances of optical illusion: vivisected and hung out to display, their skin cut into strips or their genitals wrenched open and rubbed with peppers. They are aligned with the surrounding \u2018obscene orchids\u2019, some of which resemble \u2018human organs\u2019.<cite>TG., 139-140.<\/cite> Hence the disconnect between seeing and believing turns around not only grotesque facts of form, but also the display of such \u2018curiosities\u2019. The dynamic is twisted further in Clara\u2019s sexual exaltation: cheeks flushing, mouth open, nipples stiffening beneath the silk of her dress, she cries out in hysterical pleasure at the various spectacles to be had.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colonial context of the novel links it with the \u2018human zoos\u2019 that displayed invaded and enslaved peoples that would reach a horrifying zenith in the worst days of European colonialism, often focusing on \u2018extreme\u2019 body parts, such as arses.<cite>As was the case with Sarah Baartman, a Khoekhoe woman forcibly displayed in Paris around 1815.<\/cite> The novel explicitly engages these themes as a political response to the Dreyfus affair, a contemporaneous political scandal in France following the public discovery that a Jewish artillery officer was convicted for treason using false documents forged by government officials. This fomented a crisis in faith in the political establishment and the state \u2018machine\u2019, as inflected by anti-Semitism and France\u2019s ongoing colonial entanglements\u2014Alfred Dreyfus being imprisoned in a colonial prison island in Guiana. And so the machinated violence of human horticulture specularises the resurgence of racist iconography in the anti-Dreyfus newspapers of the period, one of which ran a series called the \u2018<em>Mus\u00e9e des Horreurs<\/em>\u2019, displaying Jewish public figures with the bodies of apes, serpents and farm animals. The novel thus emphasizes what Emily Apter has called the \u2018pornographic cast\u2019 of voyeuristic racism,<cite>Emily Apter, \u201cIn the Garden of Scopic Perversion: From Monet to Mirbeau,\u201d October 47(1988): 91-115., 101. Apter traces the genesis of scotoma from Charcot to Freud and Mirbeau and as such I draw on her significantly here.<\/cite> its critique embedded in a sort of literary gaslighting that aestheticises structural horror:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>If in the private world of the self the punishments for [scopophilic looking] imposed by the ego assumed a form of hysteria, in the public realm they signalled a crisis of judgement, an imbalance in the careful treaty made by civilisation between sexual drives and their institutional sublimation.<\/p><cite>Apter., 91.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is the accusation of European barbarism that is reflected in the Chinese garden, with one prisoner\u2019s crime named as \u2018stealing rice from the English.\u2019 We also learn the unnamed narrator is in China to escape charges of embezzlement, under the pretext of being a comparative embryologist. His mission to search coral reefs for the \u2018primordial cell of organised life\u2019, was only just chosen over observing the English penitentiary administrations in Tasmania and Fiji. So the visual conflation of horticulture and torture practices gives way to a larger critique of the pursuits of European society in general: its carceral practices being indistinguishable from its natural sciences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But whether this critique is effective is another matter: the novel maintains the compelling quality of its violent optics through the eroticised vicariousness of Clara. Such multilayered voyeurism reaches its apex after Clara\u2019s visit has ended, and she processes the dazzling horrors of the garden in a visually spectacular hysterical fit. Her body goes into a \u2018rainbow posture\u2019, strenuously arching into the air between her feet and neck. This movement is characteristic of the <em>clownisme<\/em> that Charcot observed in hysterics at the apex of their episodes, their gestures becoming larger like those of trained acrobats as their bodies became distorted at the limit of physical duress. This change in Clara is accompanied by what reads as an ocular scotoma: her eyes are \u2018half-closed, twitching\u2019, only the whites on display.<cite>TG., 196.<\/cite> Visually castrated, she appears to purge the grotesqueries of the garden that formerly elicited such excitement. Coming down from her corporeal rainbow, the hypersaturated garden has given way to her exhausted profession: \u2018I\u2019m all white\u2026 all white\u2026 like an anemone!\u2019<cite>TG., 197.<\/cite> She too has become a flower, or else the narrator\u2019s coral reef cell, weirdly anticipating the reef bleaching that will be an eventual outcome of white colonial violence. As Clara is revealed as constitutive of the garden, a privileged and eroticised remix of the social and ecological violence of horticulture\/torture, her sleeping eyes are equated with genitalia in the incisive threat of further optic penetration. Only when they are closed, \u2018can she do no evil, either to others or herself\u2019.<cite>TG., 198.<\/cite> But this is belied in the novel\u2019s final image as she is confronted with the racist counterpoint of a \u2018bronze ape\u2019 extending a \u2018monstrous phallus\u2019 towards her closed lids.<cite>TG., 199.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, the novel\u2019s attempt to specularise violence through multilayered erotic voyeurism keeps coming back to the \u2018private parts\u2019 as a site for optical illusion. The chief executioner tells Clara that in one of his more exalted inventions the mechanism is concealed. The \u2018rat torture\u201d involves a starving rodent placed in a box and strapped to a victim\u2019s arse, into which it is incited to burrow to escape a hot poker. The episode anticipates a famous scene from another novel that also exploits a line between sexual violence and social power structures, Brett Easton-Ellis\u2019s <em>American Psycho<\/em>. In it, the serial-killing and sushi-loving investment banker Patrick Bateman sleeps with a woman before causing a starving rat to burrow into her vagina.<cite>According to Apter, this episode in Le Jardin also apparently instigated the neuroses of Freud\u2019s well-known patient \u2018The Rat Man\u2019.<\/cite> The rupture of the genitals is a violent physical parody of penetration and sexual pleasure, like when Bateman goes down on another woman during a threesome and her moans of pleasure give way to screams of pain as he begins to chew her up. The optics of all these scenes are highly important, with Bateman\u2019s care for his privileged physical presentation mirroring the sexual atrocities he inflicts on his often marginalised victims. In <em>Le Jardin<\/em>, the genitals meet the eye most explicitly in the \u2018torture of the caress\u2019: a man is restrained and masturbated rapidly for four hours by a plainclothed woman, \u2018not young, not beautiful\u2019; an expert. The victim dies \u2018in a jet of blood, which splattered the entire face of the tormentress\u2019, a confusion of parts and liquids that twists the intense pornographic spectacle of the facial into a moment of horror, <em>la<\/em> <em>petite mort<\/em> into <em>la<\/em> <em>grande mort<\/em>.<cite>\u2018Never have I seen anything so atrocious\u2019, says Clara, \u2018I still think of it!\u2019 (TG., 112).<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/05\/28094913\/AUGUSTE-RODIN-Mirabeau-Octave-Jardin-des-supplices-1902.jpg\" alt=\"Auguste Rodin, 'Mirabeau, Octave, Jardin des supplices' (1902)\" class=\"wp-image-1060\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The continuum between optical illusion and genital cutting is extended in the watercolours produced by Auguste Rodin to illustrate the 1902 edition of <em>Le Jardin<\/em>.

That\u2019s not as easy! Ha, ha!<\/p><cite><em>TG.,&nbsp;<\/em>144.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Described as possessing the \u2018joviality of a surgeon\u2019 the executioner is a literal sculptor of human flesh who remakes sexual forms. Rodin was himself better known as a sculptor; the more famous marbles of twisting bodies with heads blurring into the fundament strangely recall the cover of my father\u2019s Dictionary of Sex. He renders the woman (who might be) made into a man by the surgeon with a spreading aberration that runs across her archetypal curve of hips, dripping down her thighs in bloody tendrils. She is curled against a plant of plain foliage, suggesting her as its singular bloom. At her groin the phallic smudge of a crocus appears, a floral motif that repeats across the series of watercolours to extend the novel\u2019s suggestion of \u2018human horticulture\u2019 in a language of bleeding flowers. But this print is significant because of the introduction of a spliced phallic part. It renders cutting not just as castration or penetration but also as haploid endowment: in this case the cause of the illusion as it spreads scotoma-like across the normative form. As Apter notes, the novel twists the ocular castration of psychoanalytic scotoma by operating according to a divergent logic: \u2018the stain marks the spot where scotomisation <em>fails<\/em> to censor\u2019.<cite>Apter., 103.<\/cite><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>The possibility of optical illusions straightforwardly revealing the latent machinations of the individual\/society is a common theme in their interpretation. Escher\u2019s work, for example, perhaps the most recognisable artistic exploitation of optical illusion\u2014with the exception of the Mona Lisa\u2014struggled to find a place in the art world because it was perceived as too literal or didactic. As such, his images have been more often favoured by mathematicians and scientists over art critics. Only with the rise of 60s counterculture did Escher\u2019s work begin to garner mainstream recognition, when his images found perverse place as sometime-guiding mats for tripping hippies. He was championed in <em>Rolling Stone<\/em> as the \u2018godfather of psychedelic art\u2019, indicating a belief that his work revealed something not just about the machinations of perception, but of the machinations of society as well.<cite>See Patrick Elliott, \u2018A very serious game: the work of M.C. Escher,\u2019 National Galleries Scotland, 15 June 2015.<\/cite> Indeed the landmarks of his work\u2014enormous hands drawing the form of themselves, animals and humans tessellated as floor tiles, or people traversing impossible staircases\u2014can be read through the countercultural metaphor of the era that cast the individual as a cog turning in a great machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scientific uptake of optical illusions has likewise relied on the machine as a key analogy in understanding neural processes. Optical illusions have been particularly important in computational neuroscience, a field defined in relation to the analogy of the brain-as-computer, a powerful machine crafted not by humans or even their sky-god, but by the anthropomorphic hand of evolutionary selection. For such scientists, optical illusions reveal gaps in the brain\u2019s visual processing software, with cues for depth, size, direction, etc. working in disharmony to give a false impression where they would normally be synthesized and accurate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider a famous optical illusion that has enjoyed success in neuroscience as well as the memeing internet: Noboyuki Kayahara\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.procreo.jp\/labo\/labo13.html\">Spinning Dancer<\/a>. Because of a lack of depth cues that are given in the flat black silhouette, she can be perceived as spinning either clockwise or anticlockwise, changing directions depending on the viewer\u2019s neurological processes. Though changeable, these reactions are generally bifurcated along the lines of who sees what first, a fact which spawned chain emails in the late 2000s claiming seeing one direction indicated a \u2018right-brained\u2019 personality whereas seeing the other meant you were \u2018left-brained\u2019. It is interesting that, unlike other popular internet illusions, the dancer is sexualised in archetypal nakedness, with ample breasts, erect nipples and cutesy ponytail all being essential in determining the position she is facing. Her tight waistline forms a neutrality when she faces away\/towards the viewer, uncertain of her next move. In explanations of the illusion\u2019s function all these features are carefully noted, but they tend to gloss the subliminal sexual subtext. It adds a further boggling element for the mostly male neuroscientists and programmers who have fixated on the dancer\u2019s illusion, her parts frenetically rotating over the glassy eyes of those who just want to know how she works. It is reminiscent of the popular and \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/imomus.livejournal.com\/118823.html\">curiously erotic<\/a>\u2019 game many will remember from the 2000s: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vagenisonline.com\/flash\/fallingbody.html\">Tetka<\/a>, in which a blonde woman in a bikini falls corpse-like through an adjustable gravitational field, colliding with bubbles to achieve all sorts of brutal and compromising positions. On the Spinning Dancer\u2019s Wikipedia page, the bifurcated effect of her movement is given comparison in a rotating PET scan of a woman\u2019s interior, and it is instead her organs that are definitive for direction discernment. These telling touches bring us back to the question of cutting as it relates to optical illusion, and the sexualised perforation of the interior\/exterior that seems to be suggested by them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/05\/28094918\/Spinning_Dancer.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1055\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010 computational neurologists Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam produced a study that applied a logic of optical illusion to contemporary sexual practices, particularly as it relates to the consumption of pornography. <cite>A summary of their research was given at Google concurrent with the publication with their book.<\/cite> Purportedly the first scientists to study sexual taste since Alfred Kinsey, their research had a profound impact on the field bordering on the sensational with the publication of their book <em>A Billion Wicked Thoughts<\/em>. Their Penguin book deal caused many to question their motives as they sought to conduct part of their research on LiveJournal and other platforms for the slashfiction and incipient (pre-Tumblr) internet queer communities, where shoddy methodological practices caused them to be fatally cancelled for a highly leading survey containing several offensive language errors. But their research also drew on several non-survey sources, including search engine and porn site data as well as interviews with adult industry professionals, giving some credence to their findings, which are outlandishly interesting to my discussion here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ogas and Gaddam found that there were four major search terms that formed the basis of porn sought out by straight men. In order of popularity, these were tits, dicks, arses, and feet. Accordingly, they uncovered a prevalence that until recently has been relegated to a place of subliminal denial in popular culture: that girls with dicks are highly sought after by straight men. They gave the explanation that trans women, or \u2018shemales\u2019 as they were termed by the researchers in line with porn terminology, represent an <em>optical illusion<\/em> in their simultaneous combination of all these sexual cues, which are otherwise separated by physiological possibility. The optical illusion of women with dicks was emblematised for the researchers in the Japanese anime genre futinari, which typically shows young schoolgirls with penises in a range of sexual scenarios. The appeal of the genre revolves around the apparent juxtaposition of the penis with the archetypal feminine form, complete with breasts, hairless buttocks, and small feet. The characters\u2019 balls are sometimes substituted with vaginas too. <cite>Incidentally, \u2018pussy\u2019 was a porn search term that the researchers struggled to gain data for because of its intense metonymic valence in representing women as whole beings.<\/cite> For Ogas and Gaddam, anime represents a more \u2018perfect\u2019 evolution of the illusion that was formerly mainly offered by real trans porn performers, presumably because drawn figures able to combine idealised feminine proportions in a way that eclipses what is typically possible in the real world. To put their argument another way: futinari was seen as effectively engineered as a genre of erotic illusion, combining major erotic visual cues in order to trip a misdirected desire response from straight men. It was this that caused the researchers to speculate that illustrated (or computer generated) erotica would eventually supplant real trans porn performers entirely, squaring the illusion away from the production of a body that has no place in evolutionary biology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ogas and Gaddam\u2019s findings thus operate along computational neurology\u2019s typical response to optical illusions, where in producing an impossible perception, they reveal gaps in the brain\u2019s processing software. But the researchers also point to an expressly <em>libidinal<\/em> focus for this perception, where the line between seeing and believing is filled with spontaneous sexual arousal for the impossible. In this is a strange psychology that points to half-knowing that what one is viewing isn\u2019t really \u2018true\u2019, producing a sort of uncanny, preconscious snapback not unlike the scotomatic retaliation that Freud\u2019s ego inflicts upon the eye.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theory of optical illusion also allowed Ogas and Gaddam to explain another trending sexual taste as it appeared for women around the same time: the fetishisation of the vampiric <em>Twilight<\/em> lead Edward Cullen. Like trans women, the alpha, love-ridden vampire was seen as activating a series of erotic cues but for women, including masculine devotion and protectiveness, physical prowess, independence, experience, wealth, and wholesome good looks. Cullen is a hundred years old but has the flawless skin of a teenager; he is a dazzle of shadow, a boy with a bloodlust who literally sparkles in the sunshine. The same uncanny snapback is presumed in this, where his fantastic status as a vampiric illusion means fans know he isn\u2019t real, that he isn\u2019t human in the same way that trans women \u2018aren\u2019t really\u2019 women, but desirability remains intact. But there is a distinction between the two monstrous illusions in the researchers\u2019 logic: where the trans woman\u2019s body is cut up into parts and cues, Cullen\u2019s is wrapped inside a more complete narrative, a hard perfection almost too good to be true. His well-known bloodlust for Bella and gallant abstinence from giving into this hunger, \u2018because he loves her too much\u2019, makes of him an illusion like a glittering knife, desirable in the way Patrick Bateman is desirable, because he is capable of such thorough annihilation.<cite>Though vampires like Cullen are their main example, Ogas and Gaddam name four other types of fantastic male monsters that are favoured in erotica: pirates, werewolves, billionaires, and surgeons.<\/cite> So the erotics of cutting have implication for the viewing subject as well: if Cullen is hot because of his propensity to sever the bodies of masochistic fans, trans women are hot because they are already severed, such a fragile assemblage of parts that the straight guys seeking them don\u2019t even have to chew their food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if Ogas and Gaddam\u2019s adherence to computational neurology\u2019s approach to optical illusions causes them to cut up the body of the trans woman into a holistically impossible series of visual cues, they also cut up the male brain into various discrete parts each responding to these cues. This sort of science has led to the by now familiar anecdote that the prevalence of foot fetishes is because the part of the brain that processes the perception of genitalia is adjacent to the part that processes the perception of feet.<cite>Originating as passing speculation in the work of Vilayanur S. Ramachandran. See his book with Blakeslee Phantoms in the Brain (New York: William Morrow, 1998).<\/cite> Underpinning the theory is a \u2018modular\u2019 approach to visual perception that cuts the brain into discrete perceiving areas. Rather than having a strict biological basis, this approach actually has its roots in computer coding, which early on encountered problems with often long and unwieldy reams of code that were too densely interconnected to easily read or revise. Hal Sedgwick and Barbara Gillam explain:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Such code came to be called, disparagingly, spaghetti code. As computers became faster, cheaper, and more capable, the emphasis shifted to [\u2026] code [that] was more structured and so was more readily understandable. A key concept in this transformation was modularity [\u2026] breaking the overall task of the program down into smaller units, or modules, and trying to reduce the interdependency between these modules.<\/p><cite>H. A. Sedgwick and Barbara Gillam, \u2018A Non-Modular Approach to Visual Space Perception,\u2019&nbsp;<em>Ecological Psychology&nbsp;<\/em>28.2 (2017): 72-94<em>.,&nbsp;<\/em>72.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after the introduction of modular code, computational neurology begins to apply the same principle to models of human brain function. Sedgwick and Gillam go on to name a few non-modular mechanisms in visual processing, such as the interplay between local and non-local processing, relevant to the perception of optical illusions because it takes into consideration proximity of objects to each other when estimating their individual depths. There are a number of factors that are not taken into account by Ogas and Gaddam\u2019s employment of erotic optical illusions that are taken into account by surrounding science and sociology, for example prior perceptual experience and broader social norms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But regardless of the modular holes in the researchers\u2019 analysis, their consideration of optical illusions also contains a latent self-critique, where the \u2018cuts\u2019 of perceptual disjunction are surrounded by an incorrigible desire for whole typologies, exceeding the modular model of visual perception. Optical fascination may bleed into erotic arousal through the straightforward violence of cutting, but an image with a face has nevertheless been created. Irigaray is coming back to me again, with her riff upon Alice, a character in Michel Soutter\u2019s absurdist film <em>The Surveyors <\/em>(1972): \u201c<em>Alice\u2019s eyes are blue. And <\/em>red. <em>She opened them while going through the mirror. Except for that, she still seems to be exempt from violence.<\/em>\u201d<cite>Irigaray., 9.<\/cite> Alice is confined to the house and the garden, her departed mother\u2019s property, where she is visited by the surveyors of the film\u2019s title and made love to. In the various visits however, she appears to change into a completely different woman, with a changed demeanor, hair, everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Who deserves more sexual gratitude, the woman who duplicates the possibility of sexual pleasure or the woman who offers it a first time? And if one goes back and forth between them, how can one keep on telling them apart? How can one know where one sits, where one stands? The confusion sits with Lucien. He\u2019s delighted.<\/p><cite>Irigaray<em>.,&nbsp;<\/em>13.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A hot cyborg, Alice\u2019s inter\/changeability is part of her appeal, wherein she can be phenotypically programmed in order to fulfil an endless possibility of erotic scenarios. The desiring look is befuddled by the sheer magnitude of these options, which are subject to a shaky snapback into rational surveying. \u201c<em>Can pleasure be measured, bounded, triangulated, or not?<\/em>\u201d Irigaray wonders. Alice is rendered human\/not human with her \u201c<i>violet, violated eyes<\/i>\u201d having been through a mirror that can be read at once as a screen or alternatively as a knife.&nbsp;<cite>Irigaray., 10.<\/cite>&nbsp;The attempt to quantify her duplicity, to trace the code and formula of her, is the libidinal thrust of sexual cutting as projected through the new technology of the computer in modular cognitive approaches to mysterious desire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Processing the violently desired body through concurrent technological novelties is an operation that unites <em>Le Jardin des Supplices<\/em> and <em>A Billion Wicked Thoughts<\/em>. Just as emergent sciences like botany and psychiatry, inextricably linked with the violent efforts of Western European colonialism, define the face of eroticised bodily atrocity in the garden, so the emergent power of Silicone Valley defines the bodies lustfully seen and spliced in the brutalising garden of the internet. The machine is real, and though the genesis I have traced of mostly white men\u2019s dirty thoughts is specific, the infiltration of commercial computers and the culture they have created and feed upon is a recognisable and growing factor in the dynamics of desire. Literally shaping optics and shaping bodies, most of us are both party and subject to the culture that plays out in camera-captured tricks of light endlessly delivered to billions of greedy eyes on various platforms. Image culture is always shifting, activating a backlog of historical optical experiences; who among you hasn\u2019t visited a porn site and experienced the jumping interruption of a pop-up webcam girl bored and rolling around in her room, or the diagnosis of a virus having infiltrated your Mac, meaning it needs cleaning right away, or else?<\/p>\n",

This ring is of course the seventh circle of Hell known to the public as the KAWS show at the NGV which officially closed on the unholy date of April the 13<sup>th<\/sup><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> (although the gallery has been shut for some time due to plague conditions). I hesitated at first because of a certain laziness with regard to taste. Who cares if the scholars and artists \u2013 who have long since become one and the same class anyway \u2013 understand this show? And secondly, because of a certain cowardice in regard to airing what seems to be a blasphemous opinion. And thirdly, because of how predictably contrarian it is to blaspheme good taste. By now we know that the race to find the most obscure artist\u2019s artist always ends in disappointment. And that disappointment leads us to advocate for the most deranged and populist nonsense we can find. Bad art has always made for edgy opinions. And in Melbourne in particular, where bad taste and kitsch reign supreme, the statement \u2018KAWS was the best show I saw this year\u2019 is par for the course. Nonetheless I will press on in spite of or perhaps because of such dangers. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To talk about the politics of the blockbuster show is dull. We have all heard the critique of the spectacle, whether in Guy Debord\u2019s initial iteration of the concept in his book from 1967 or in the writing of a thousand copy-cat theorists it has spawned. For Debord spectacular society marks the point where the commodity form is perfected in the image. He writes, \u201cI<\/span><span class=\"s3\">n societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.\u201d <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Whether or not we buy his wider economic analysis is hardly important because all that remains of his critique within artistic discourse is the word spectacle. And it was as if the KAWS show was designed to incite such critique and indeed, as Debord himself would say, it probably is. Spectacular society for Debord is masterful at recuperating and marketing its own denunciation as a commodity.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">KAWS in this sense is the spectacular artist par excellence. The letters that make up the word KAWS don\u2019t mean anything, they don\u2019t stand for anything, they are as all tags are language becoming image. No wonder Debord was so frightened, his beloved medium of philosophy, which he believed was destined to lead humanity to freedom, was getting trounced by billboards and magazines. As a committed Hegelian-Marxist Debord was perplexed \u2014 what had gone wrong? Well let\u2019s just say KAWS happened. In other words, mass consumption became something more than just an economic imperative. It was transfigured into a religious rite \u2014 something entwined with our most fervent desires and inseparable from breathing or eating. Or as Debord moans, \u201cthe spectacle is the material rebuilding of religious illusion.\u201d In other words, all hail the second coming of our redeemer KAWS.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s4\">We are greeted upon entering the NGV foyer by the giant statue which Butler alludes to in the above quotation. It is undeniably ridiculous and yet nonetheless retains a certain solemnity. It is this collision of the ridiculous and the religious which dominates the show. A figure with crossed out cartoon eyes \u2014 which is the key KAWSian signature \u2014 holds a dead or dying Elmo. With Elmo\u2019s head tossed back we recall, perhaps subconsciously the archaic gesture of the <\/span><span class=\"s5\">piet\u00e0<\/span><span class=\"s4\"> and if we didn\u2019t the handy informative plaque nearby is there to reminds us. It is the image of the Virgin holding the dead Christ whose most famous iteration was sculpted by Michelangelo. It is the melodrama of religious sculpture which is at stake here, the beauty of which an avowed atheist like Debord cannot ever really understand. It\u2019s also very stupid (I dare say stupidity elevated to a fine art), which is another thing that, for an arch-rationalist like Debord, is an anathema to not merely art but humanity itself. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But we must back pedal for a moment. I was completely unaware of who KAWS was until he appeared on Justin Bieber\u2019s Instagram story. The show provides the uninitiated with a serviceable potted history of KAWS in its first room through a series of stunning prints of photos of his initial tags on the streets of New York City. We learn that KAWS emerged from the fertile commercial pastures of the graffiti scene of New York in the 1990s and can be broadly grouped with the <i>Beautiful Losers<\/i> \u2014 or professional slackers, canonised in the 2004 exhibition and 2008 film of the same name. Like Stephen Espo J. Powers or Shepard Obey Fairey and other members of this so-called scene, KAWS represents for many the degeneration of an authentic New York street culture associated with Patti Astor\u2019s Fun Gallery and the East Side in the 1980s. For these nostalgic souls KAWS is the Giuliani of graffiti who, like Banksy in Britain, marks the canonisation and institutionalisation of graff as \u2018street art\u2019. But weren\u2019t Haring and Basquiat, who are now on show at the NGV, also obsessed with success? Didn\u2019t they too seek to become international megabrands and market their work to the ecstatic masses? <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The notion that KAWS has sold out from his initial commitment to \u2018culture jamming\u2019 \u2014 the rather quaint 90s update of Debord\u2019s notion of <i>detournement \u2014 <\/i>is wildly inaccurate. As KAWS himself notes, <\/span><span class=\"s6\">\u201cI liked the [advertising] images. I painted over them because they were omnipresent.\u201d <\/span><span class=\"s1\">KAWS, then Brian Donnelly, studied illustration at New York\u2019s School of Visual Art receiving a BFA in 1996. He then worked as an illustrator for cartoons such as <i>Daria <\/i>and <i>Doug<\/i>. In the exhibition\u2019s first room things begin to become clear. Here is an institutionally trained artist, aware of the history of art (he cites Oldenburg and Richter as key references), fiendishly talented as an illustrator, with just enough ties to graff subculture to give off a whiff of authenticity. A subculture that had long since lost any real underground status but which remained an important marketing tool in the late 1990s. It soon becomes clear that KAWS is the model for the artist of the millennium. In him will be incarnated that unholy trinity \u2014 graphic designer, art historian, entrepreneur \u2014 which has come to define any artist whose success propels them out of the ghetto of contemporary art and into the public consciousness. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And boy, are the public interested in KAWS. In the days leading up to visiting the show I began to notice KAWSian motifs everywhere. On t-shirts, tote bags and caps, the KAWS tag is everywhere, whether in the form of Sesame Street style lettering or the dead-eyed cartoon. What the KAWS show makes violently apparent is that the logic of branding and tagging are inseparable. This observation is hardly original but organised in these rooms this logic begins to take the form of a kind of mania as we traipse through the show. Indeed, this is the principal KAWSian gesture \u2014 batter the viewer into submission with an image because subtlety is for the old and the dull. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The KAWS machine is not merely ambitious but hungry. It seeks to consume everything and recreate the world in its own image. In these rooms every conceivable cartoon is dragged inexorably into the KAWSian canon \u2014 Disney, The Simpsons, Pokemon, Sponge Bob, all are conscripted in this multicoloured assault on the eye. In doing so we have a genealogy of the cartoon itself, an object often used within fine art to allegorise capital. The cartoon operates, like the value form, through the power of equivalence \u2014 Mickey\u2019s glove transforms into a hammer and then a propeller and then back again. For critics like Benjamin Buchloh the scrawling of Raymond Pettibon represented the dark critical underside to Pop Art\u2019s celebratory embrace of the cartoon and the comic strip. But KAWS moves against both the Pop and critical currents. His success is further evidence that death is no longer repressed by capital but is triumphantly celebrated as its increasingly volatile motor. If Pettibon sought to unearth capital\u2019s violent unconscious, in KAWS this unconscious is merrily on display and we the public dance along to the tune of our own dismemberment. Its power is undoubtedly in part due to the cartoons we can barely recall, images from hazy childhood afternoons spent in front of the TV dimly recorded in the recesses of our memory. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That the show is designed to be photographed in front of is another truism that hardly bears repeating. The same logic dominates the Terracotta Warriors show which was running earlier last year and it\u2019s difficult not to make comparisons at least in regards to their shared curatorial logic. Both shows are designed with the Chinese market in mind and both are elaborately designed photo opportunities. But while the warriors suffer from becoming props in a hall of mirrors, KAWS panoply of colourful characters shine in this setting. The characters have names like <\/span><span class=\"s6\">Companion, Accomplice, Chum or BFF<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. At the end of the exhibition there are a series of Morning Glory-style photobooths so we can actually become KAWS \u2014 cross out our eyes and cover our mouths with enormous gloves. Ostensibly the show is \u2018about\u2019 our atomised and alienated subjectivity at the mercy of technology and consumption. The show\u2019s title \u2018Companionship in the Age of Loneliness\u2019 hammers that home for all those who might have missed it. Whoever has written the descriptions for these works has really outdone themselves. It\u2019s comedy of the driest and most ironic kind, something close to a Douglas Huebler comic strip or an Andrea Fraser performance piece. It reaches its apogee in a statement by the NGV\u2019s head curator of contemporary art Simon Maidment who describes KAWS as <\/span><span class=\"s6\">\u201ca great kind of humanist, who is engaging on quite an emotional level with people.\u201d A wonderful and hilarious conceit which also happens to be true.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But when it comes to the rest of the rooms my memory is rather scattered. Debord describes the spectacle as, \u201cthe absolute mastery of memory\u201d. Or in this case memory\u2019s absolute demolition. This is amnesiac art of the highest order which thrives on the entwinement of photographability and forgetfulness. I dimly recall taking photos of my friend Matthew in front of statues of KAWS. I vaguely remember that the characters are always in baroque pathetic postures, covering their mouths and their eyes in gestures of submission. Predictably we begin to photograph others taking photographs. But any sense of ironic distance has by this time been utterly eroded. We are at the mercy of a higher power. We are being guided by something else. We have learnt to stop worrying and love the KAWS.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When we emerge from this orgiastic frenzy and check the photos we have taken, what strikes us is the way this fiendish logic of appropriation masterfully combines pop culture images with a fine art nous. That is not to say these references are necessarily direct ones but rather they allow us to believe in the appropriateness of canonising a glorified branding agent. These statues, paintings, digital collages and ornaments all look like art. This is in part the result of their appearance in a gallery which, as theorist Thierry De Duve never ceases to remind us, is an automatic canonising machine. But it\u2019s also because of their uncanny use of art historical tropes and references. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One room features a couch made out of dead Snoopys. It could easily pass for one of Mike Kelley\u2019s soft toy works, although it is Kelley through the eyes of a designer and hence not Kelley at all. And of course, the blown-up statues remind us of Oldenburg \u2014 and like Oldenburg whose key reference was the Macy\u2019s Day Parade, KAWS understands that big is always better. This maximalist logic is an allegory of America itself, or of a more successful America, when American art really was at the forefront of the avant-garde. And while this is clearly no longer the case (does anyone really care about New York anymore?), we are reminded of the great evangelist Jeff Koons, perhaps the last American artist to really matter in a world-historical sense. And like Koons, his work is supremely collectible, in this case through a series of affordable vinyl statues, which are a slightly more up-market variation of the Pop! Vinyl dolls so popular amongst the more unfortunate slaves of the Disney merchandising empire. It\u2019s all so celebratory and yet so canny that one finds it difficult to return to these canonical avant-garde strategies \u2014 seriality, appropriation, montage \u2014 without wondering if they were all merely preparatory moments leading up to their most effective realisation in the delicious monstrosity that is KAWS. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But other references feel a little closer to home. The cartoon collage paintings could easily have emerged from the VCA painting department in the last five years. They bear all the hallmarks of the post-Helen Johnson obsession with the cartoon and the caricature, conscripted in a desperate attempt to paint one\u2019s way out of the dead-end of neo-formalism. The statues too are reminiscent of the rash of 3D printed \u2018critical design\u2019 works that have inundated us in recent times \u2014 indeed, I was often reminded of the Greatest Hits show at West Space in 2018 but without any of that show\u2019s clunky attempts at criticality. Even the murky subcultural origins of KAWS in the graffiti scene is a hallmark of the young institutionalised Melbourne artist who longs for an exit from a stifling education through a quasi-mystical glorification of the poetry of the street. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That the entire exhibition is really a long line for the gift shop once more strikes us as a pathetically inadequate clich\u00e9. It is much more than this. We do not simply walk through KAWS. We are herded. It is an exhilarating feeling, succumbing to the Baudelairean allure of drowning oneself in the crowd. Indeed, it was a rather similar feeling to attending the Climate Strike in September, except instead of being surrounded by self-righteous activists one was instead part of an army of hype-beast clad international students. The correlation between the popularity of Off White (Virgil Abloh\u2019s empire of fake fashion chic) and KAWS is not accidental either. Both have managed to tap into the hearts and minds of the greatest consumer culture in history, namely post-socialist China. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2rMKPkNTKEY\"><span class=\"s7\">video<\/span><\/a> has been circulating online which shows Chinese KAWS fans fighting as they try to score a new T-shirt. There is an entire story about the rise and domination of streetwear to be told here for which I do not have the time nor the patience. But the KAWS collaboration with Uniqlo for this show is merely the tip of a very deep and treacherous iceberg that includes collaborations with everyone from Nike to Dior as well as his own label Original Fake. In fact, given Butler\u2019s favourable review of the radical aesthetics of NGV\u2019s Comme show he might be surprised to learn that KAWS has also collaborated with Comme\u2019s own dreadful streetwear label, Play.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Frenzy in China for Uniqlo&#039;s Kaws collection\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2rMKPkNTKEY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br class=\"\">But we must return to the scene of the crime. The line for the gift shop is tense. Everyone eagerly awaits their little piece of KAWS. A salesperson disguised as a gallery attendant emerges to tell us that certain items have sold out. A worried murmur runs through the crowd. Everyone busily checks their phones to see what still remains and to check the resale price on Grailed. This is the most exciting moment in the show. For all its zany morbidity the work remains utterly forgettable. But such outmoded notions of value such as memory do not apply to KAWS. We are dealing with an art of ephemera at its most sophisticated. Attempts to theorise this entire show as an example of the \u2018experience economy\u2019 seem overly simplistic. Or rather one cannot theorise away the joy of consumption, the thrill of the chase, or the pleasure of receiving a like on a photo with KAWS. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Walter Benjamin remains one of the few Marxists to have understood the utopian power of the commodity which contains within it the dream of a transformed world. Benjamin also understood its religious quality, noting the manner in which consumption \u201cproscribes the ritual according to which the commodity fetish wishes to be worshipped.\u201d The Kawsian souvenir is, as Benjamin noted, \u201ca secularised relic\u201d and the saintly relic of course \u201ccomes from the corpse.\u201d It seems only death can be worshipped today. And submission and surrender to an all-powerful deity is exhilarating. Today we struggle to account for the religiosity of capital. And KAWS by any other name would be capital. And, like capital, it appears very unlikely that KAWS is going away any time soon.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is telling that the only other phenomenon that comes close to the grandeur and majesty of KAWS is Socialist Realist monuments, which Warhol famously described as akin to pop artworks. The problem is that until the left can provide an alternative that is as seductive, demonic and, yes, beautiful as KAWS, we will remain trapped here. Perhaps the inability to understand KAWS stands for a greater historical amnesia \u2014 an incapacity to understand why we will our own oppression rather than will nothing at all. Why we are still in awe of monuments and statues and sneakers and collectibles. It certainly points to a greater malaise within aesthetic judgement \u2014 lacking a shared formal language, we cannot really talk about why we like the art we like. Instead, we wrap ourselves in a cloak of philosophical and artistic references in the hope that this proximity will provide us with protection from the outside world. Position-taking around taste is nothing new but this phenomenon reaches its zenith today in the absurd fear of young artists who don\u2019t want their references stolen. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The KAWSian cartoon with its dead eyed stare, painfully aware that it is merely a pathetic variation on an existing theme, is perhaps the greatest portrait of the contemporary artist and critic today. We cower behind our good taste and our barely concealed disdain for the masses all the while parading our political radicality in verbose artist statements and exegeses. KAWS himself remains absolutely immune to this kind of neurosis. He has found peace with capital. Or better yet, he has made a devilish pact with it. To attain eternal life in this way is also to invite eternal death and this show, which makes of death a pageant and a festival, is wonderfully appropriate. Until the day we are liberated by the critical theorists and social activists, we must find our joy somewhere. And I for one think the KAWS show is an essential ritual for those of us who still thirst for a taste of the sacred. <\/span><\/p>\n",

Over 20 million people died without account, buried by the heap, and the face of society was irrevocably altered. The extremist caricature of the West as a healthy, homogenised social body was upgraded and the human project entirely beholden to its inherited authority.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1911, the cover illustration of an edition of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le Petit Journal<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> featured a horizon aflame and a red-cloaked grim reaper ravaging the landscape of Manchuria, scythe looming over the scrambling survivors.

The subsumption of life under capital extends to an ideal of freedom modelled on the freedom of the market. 2003\u2019s SARS got off with a warning however, 2020&#8217;s COVID-19 has thus far been a mortal affront to worldwide axioms of negative liberty, exchange value and capital accumulation. As external restraints, fear and a duty of care enforce self-isolation, the language of freedom has become blatantly enmeshed with the economy, and every promise that we will endure tied inexorably to the resurgence of the market. Meanwhile, as we wait to &#8216;restart,&#8217; our sense of time begins to distort. We are confused about <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we are.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On April Fool\u2019s Day, during the SARS outbreak of 2003, the founding father of cantopop, Leslie Cheung <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u5f20\u56fd\u8363<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, finished a glass of orange juice and threw himself from the 24th floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong Island\u2019s central district. His suicide note, found in a pocket on his body,&nbsp; read:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>Depression! Many thanks to all my friends. Many thanks to Professor <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Felice_Lieh-Mak\">Felice Lieh-Mak<\/a>. This year has been so tough. I can&#8217;t stand it anymore. Many thanks to Mr. Tong.

Why does it have to be like this?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The note read more like an acceptance speech than a letter of farewell, chilling in its thanks. \u201cDepression!\u201d seemed heartily confident in itself as reason enough. The trailing exclamation mark upbeat in its conviction that there really was no better way to put it. It(!)\u2019s very understanding that it would be understood as causal, suggesting that deep discontent (providing you had an accurate estimate of things, like Cheung) is simply immanent to existence. Fair enough!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"341\" src=\"https:\/\/min.report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/LESLIE-CHEUNG_min-1-1024x341.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-962\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/04\/28094945\/LESLIE-CHEUNG_min-1-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/04\/28094945\/LESLIE-CHEUNG_min-1-1920x640.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/04\/28094945\/LESLIE-CHEUNG_min-1-600x200.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite health warnings, crowds of mourning fans congregated to pay homage to the superstar, people\u2019s grief uniting them in clusters, spurring on the spread of SARS as they waited in the rain for Cheung\u2019s hearse to pass. A moment of solidarity on the big screen veiling the microbiological feeding frenzy filling the spaces so politely maintained between them, contagion making the connections that they couldn\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is again April Fool\u2019s Day, the 17th anniversary of Cheung\u2019s death and SARS\u2019 sibling COVID-19 has infected more than 800,000 people worldwide. 2003-past and 2020-future, twisting from succession to the brink of interactivity, a moment of noise that under prescriptive Western theory is commensurate with coincidence.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I call Mei in Beijing and I can hear Cheung\u2019s 1984 hit <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monica<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crackling in the background <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOh\u2026 as time goes by, oh I came to realise how precious you are\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and on and on.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a month or so following Cheung\u2019s suicide, his songs choked Hong Kong and Mainland China\u2019s airwaves, an epidemic\u2019s bittersweet pop backdrop breaking the threshold now to colour in my own pandemic experience. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;\u201cLeslie Cheung\u2019s Boyfriend Still Misses Him 16 Years After The Hongkong Superstar\u2019s Death.\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The SARS anthem plays on, continuing its upset of the historical order of things, of connections as causal conjectures along the taut line of consequence and missed moments. The friend on the other end of this spiralling timeline (phone line) has spent three months in self-isolation. Her term of restriction is drawing to an end and yet she has not made any plans to venture outside. The outside of the small apartment she shares with her mother is now a place beyond borders.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mei has become an isolated and suspicious creature, constantly monitoring the news and others. Of course, there are risks if you are not vigilant but aren\u2019t the dark and frightening days of COVID-19 in Beijing over? Or has the contagion actually mutated our very definition of freedom into a new, peculiar and narrow ideal?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat is the Australian media saying about China?\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she asks. It is easy to relate to such grim critical vigilance. This crisis, born from a bat, has born anew the bilateral ressentiment between East and West. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThanks, thanks, thanks, Maria,\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Cheung sounds sarcastic, \u201cthanks Maria, waiguoren, external evil responsible for my nightmares.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t know what to say to her or to Cheung.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time, plot and tragedy unite as their voices combine over the phone, background and foreground flattening into noise, redoubling universes, reloading presence into the present, into a new soundscape of mutuality. This convergence can speak Cantonese, Mandarin and English. Depression(!), Contagion(!) and Cheung(!) as time traveller, accelerating this moment of temporal torsion, layering infection and discontent. I say goodbye, zaijian (<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u518d\u89c1),<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or translated directly, \u201cto see you again.\u201d&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThings add up\u2026\u201d says my Chinese tutor over skype, she is talking about the West and seems to be inferring that our model of time follows basic arithmetic. \u201cFirst SARS, now this.\u201d Cheung isn\u2019t playing in the background but there is again a distinct decentering of the clock, tock-tick. Tian Xue is already emerging from her hibernation somewhere three months into my future. What\u2019s the date? It\u2019s the 16th of April, over two million people have been infected by COVID-19, nearly 150,000 people have died and my indeterminate period of isolation has only just begun.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The progressive atomisation of society has led to the deconstruction of homogenous time. From my individual infosphere, I can\u2019t see the evidence of things adding up. I reply in chengyu, \u201c\u5149\u9634\u4f3c\u7bad, guang yin si jian.\u201d A classical chinese four-character form of idiomatic expression. I\u2019ve interpreted this particular expression to mean \u2018time flies\u2019 and say to her accordingly, \u201cI hope that time flies.\u201d Within a beat, I stand corrected, \u201c\u5149\u9634\u4f3c\u7bad, time flies like an arrow.\u201d An arrow pierces and cannot fly without the activating intervention of a human apparatus. By such a definition, time exists as an extension of its manipulator. It is a beautiful thought, if we were the manipulator. I imagine Cheung holding a bow and arrow, the time traveler arrives again, caught in the distorting pull of another virus\u2019 time machine. He begins firing arrows at its central warp core.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classical Chinese thought, throughout the canonical texts, describes time as anything but a single, straight line and Tian Xue and I turn back to these texts now, at her three months from my day dot, uniting in a dynastical past. The very word for \u2018time\u2019 in mandarin is confirmation of this aforementioned description of time \u2014 \u65f6\u95f4, shi jian.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018Shi\u2019 (\u65f6) infers time or fixed time. The character itself is the combination of radicals that paint a sun (\u65e5) and an inch (\u5bf8) together, for the sake of poetic exacerbation and for Cheung, it is the composite signifier of a sun inching across the sky.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second character, \u2018jian\u2019 (\u95f4) translates as the space between and among things. In a similarly poetic manner, it is the composite character of the radical for a door (\u95e8) and the radical for sun (\u65e5), a sun hovering within the frame of an open door.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spoken together, \u2018shi\u2019 (\u65f6) and \u2018jian\u2019 (\u95f4) speak of time as both spatially and temporally unfixed, existing between, within and throughout numerous times. Its only portent to materiality is the cycling sun, an inference of human\u2019s irrevocable accord with nature, read mortality. It can be attested that under a shijian model, time cannot be arrested. However, Tian Xue, for all of her study of the Yi Jing, (\u2018jing\u2019 (<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u7ecf<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) translates to \u2018warp\u2019 by the way) cannot help but lament that under today\u2019s inhuman systems, our arrows lay inert. Their apparatus for ignition stuck in a temporal loop, a \u2018right now\u2019 that seems to translate as \u2018the end.\u2019 I ask Tian Xue when she\u2019ll be returning to see her acupuncturist, she too admits to me that she is too afraid to go outside.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>~ Oh\u2026 as time goes by, oh I came to realise how precious you are ~<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 Mean Time, a new alien power of persecution? As our experience of time intensifies, we are compelled to continue to act purposefully and yet the common sentiment seems to be one of cynical resignation and despair. It cannot be denied that there must exist a relationship to common narratives of time however, need these narratives so profoundly guide us? It would be disadvantageous to succumb here and to postpone the capacity of our new time sensitivity to a date when the world restarts. Capitalism\u2019s test drive of the virus crisis will only lead to a new vehicle in its garage of repertoires. Immediately, we have a humanitarian crisis that exists as more than just a political project. Despite external pressures, our \u2018now\u2019 beholds a strange novelty, a temporal lurch that leaves a lot of space to explore and a lot of time travellers to meet.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as the streets of Hong Kong filled for Cheung and gave way to SARS, when COVID-19 gripped the district of Wuhan, medical professionals urged the people of Wuhan to stop screaming in solidarity from the windows of their tiny apartments. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWUHAN JIAYOU, WUHAN JIAYOU, WUHAN JIAYOU!\u201d<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, specks of spit flecked with virus filled the winter air.

How much do Australian artists and arts organisations pay in rent? Curiously, despite a relatively stable funding environment over the past seven years of Coalition Government, the arts community in Australia appears stressed. Including the Brandis raid of the Australia Council in 2014, and the eventual capitulation of the Turnbull Government to return it, relations between arts and the federal government are at an all-time low. Given the larger context of the COVID-19 pandemic that hit the Australian economy in March 2020, the subsequently massive contraction of the arts industry almost overnight also appeared to accelerate a broader shift that has been taking place across the country for some time. Now things are simply hastened and made more visible by the crisis: increasing costs, especially rental costs, mean that a large percentage of funding that comes from arts grants goes straight to landlords. Including venues that performing artists use, which largely rely on events for their income to pay the rent (in door-takings, bar-sales, patronage) also seems appropriate to this equation.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wnwxjLbOv-0\">\u2018Pay-the-rent\u2019<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s2\"> has long been a campaign slogan of the Aboriginal rights movement in Australia, &#8220;a land tax scheme where Australians who own property would pay rent to the traditional owners of that land&#8221;. This &#8216;Blak GST&#8217;\u2014Genocide, Sovereignty, Treaty\u2014seeks to shift community response to colonisation away from governments and directly onto settlers, but the idea of \u2018the lease\u2019 has its local origin in colonial claims to \u2018crown land\u2019, better imagined as the Queen\u2019s land. Queen Victoria, that is. It might also be worthwhile further counter-balancing this ledger with another Federal arts project using the rent as a function for the administration of art: <a href=\"http:\/\/artbank.gov.au\/\"><span class=\"s4\">Artbank<\/span><\/a>. Artbank was federally commissioned in 1980. Its purpose was to support artists in Australia by leasing artworks in the Artbank collection. Five years before it began the Australia Council was made a statutory body by the Whitlam Government.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">In 2012 the Council was independently reviewed and in 2013 a new Australia Council Act was passed. Since that time, the arts in Australia have been seen to be in crisis. This may simply reflect a disappointment with successive austerity governments. But at first glance, it appears that a more insidious problem is rent: a very small number of arts organisations, as well as artists, own any property in Australia, and in addition to this a further set of lease-holding businesses rely almost solely on artists in order to operate. Artbank, on the other hand is a concession scheme addressed to businesses who wish to lease artworks at a 100% tax deductable rate, <i>without <\/i>any need for ownership other than by the state (i.e. the scheme means governments, businesses, and especially individuals who are Australian taxpayers, effectively pay twice for renting works they already collectively own). In one way, it could be said that the main losers of any cuts to the Australia Council are the landlords of artists, artworks, and arts organisations (whose rents aren&#8217;t exactly forthcoming right now). That is, if we can properly alienate this fiscal equation of rent-seeking from the work artists make, some of whose current and planned works for the immediate future have now been suspended indefinitely, then the circular economy of the arts industry in Australia may in fact be properly broken.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Accepting that public trust in the logic of competition as a model for governmental regulation of, well anything, has all but &#8216;played out&#8217; and perhaps a federally supported arts industry has too. That the vagaries of excellence have replaced the previous sublimation of the battlefield, or tournament game, for funding models which use competition in their search for \u2018merit\u2019 suggests we can\u2019t have one without the other. The main question that returns us to art should be, as it always has been: is it good (i.e. does it slap)? Besides, it seems artists have always preferred the &#8216;failure&#8217; of death to a &#8216;victory&#8217; over the market when it comes to their practice. Today good work means asking if the work can sustain its art-status as \u2018non-essential work\u2019. That is, if art-work as a syntagm reveals its fundamentally non-essential essence, or its appearance, it does so only as <\/span><span class=\"s5\">work<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> (in the way Giorgio Agamben put it so simply in the 1970s).<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">&#8216;Bad&#8217; work, then, is today represented by the labour market economy. Work that is sold to others, and which we only commit to do as a means to an end: to be paid for our labour has become a means to an end. Essential things that need to be done\u2014like food, health care, education, and the provision of shelter\u2014would happen and have happened irregardless of the presence of a market economy. The obvious notion that meaningful work should be the ideal is also rapidly eroding in the era of mass automation (self-driving cars, drone logistics, etc). Meaningful work has been separated from labour, so that it no longer <i>feels <\/i>like work (is management work?). Something close to this notion could also be read into President Donald Trump\u2019s spastic alarmism over the economic crisis brought on by an actual fucking pandemic: \u201cmetaphorically speaking\u201d, the \u201ccure can\u2019t be worse than the disease\u201d. That is, the emergence of undeniably necessary work, and the dissolution of the labour market, returns to us as a nostalgia for the <i>status quo<\/i>. For too long, art has been allowed to be absorbed into this economy, as a means to an end rather than an end in itself, as a mode of being as opposed to an objective reality. Recently, contemporary art has even made labour a central theme of its aesthetic project, feeding directly into the nostalgia pointed to by President Trump so effectively, whose red MAGA cap may be the culmination of aesthetic nationalism. What I want to propose here, is that we take this current low-point\u2014perceived or actual\u2014in the Australian arts funding environment to shift our focus to a collective redefinition of art as that which is outside of this economy. Art that is made \u2018for-the-artist,\u2019 or if not for them, \u2018for-itself\u2019, and not as a means (or worse, as reduced to subsistence-only being), but as rent.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">This leads me back to my initial point at the pearl-clutching consternation over the endless defunding of art at the federal level \u2014 instead, it is better understood as the canary in the coal mine. Rather than \u201chow does art survive?\u201d the question should be: what is the relationship between the state and its funding of art that is not for-itself, and how do we get there? In 1970 the German economist Alfred Sohn-Rethel published a study that would appear 7 years later in its English translation as: <i>Intellectual and Manual Labour.<\/i> Throughout the text this duality is referred to as the distinction between \u2018head and hand\u2019. For the artist there is perceived to be a perfect unity between the two. The major study begins with a section concerning the fetishisation of intellectual labour. Sohn-Rethel was born outside of Paris to a family of artists in 1899. Despite finishing the manuscript in 1951, it took him twenty more years before the work would appear. Perhaps it was because of his proposal that the Marxist analysis needed a \u2018staircase\u2019, a mediation, which could lead us from the base to the superstructure, in order to critique philosophical epistemology. Sohn-Rethel\u2019s target was the production relations of the middle class. \u2018Individual labour,\u2019 he writes, \u2018is in full control only in the small-scale individual production of peasants and artisans.\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Indeed, if art is that which is never produced for a community, but is only able to be appropriated by one, by \u2018scaling it up\u2019 once it has been brought to those social institutions by the individual, is art in fact immune to its endless defunding (of the middle class, we might add) by the state? Most people today would agree that art will endure regardless of its funding by the state. Rather it is the state which is in danger of disappearing, not art. If so, should we not be celebrating the perpetual defunding of the arts, rather than decrying it? As it is the end of Australia that is progressively announced by the Australia Council, not the end of art. So let us not mourn the loss of those organisations who, as we realise\u2014in our deepest, darkest thoughts\u2014do not produce art anyway: they merely reproduce the industrial conditions for the arts. When it comes to the state, as the poet Harry Hooton realised in the wake of the Second World War: democracy becomes an inevitably <i>industrial <\/i>democracy. Art in this state, therefore, becomes by extension an industry, and its destiny is confirmed: all that is solid melts into air. It turns itself into money (the closest state a commodity comes to \u2018air\u2019).<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">An obvious response to this position is provided by the social history of art, the goal of historical research being the understanding of the present. That art is essential to our lives in the same way that entertainment is, for our health and wellbeing, is a part of a social system that allows us to reproduce social systems, as Niklas Luhmann might have said. In that way, the arts and entertainment industries, which have never sat comfortably with either side of the ledger, become economical. But art does not exist in a vacuum, you say, well, what if it does, and that vacuum is history? This leads me back to the question of immunity, how does one inoculate oneself from a disease for which there is no cure? Immunity is exemption, for the state it is an exception (in this way Agamben was at least somewhat correct in his analysis of European governments\u2019 responses to the pandemic). Community immunity, better known as herd immunity, was floated by governments early on in the crisis. Now it is clear that this response cannot work: there is nothing communal about transmitting a potentially fatal disease to another person\u2014let alone the eugenics assumed by the model, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/indepth\/opinion\/coronavirus-herd-immunity-eugenics-market-200414104531234.html\"><span class=\"s4\">Vito Laterza and Louis Phillipe Romer have pointed out<\/span><\/a>. Certainly, immunity is the opposite of community. The community, let\u2019s be clear, is defined as what is not the rulers or clergy. The response in the present conditions is that we are all sovereign, just some more so than others. Art is what reveals that to us today.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Artbank is administered by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications, its Headquarters are in Waterloo, Sydney. It is now responsible for warehousing and leasing 11,000 artworks owned by the people of Australia. Again, the model is key: lease artworks to local, state, and federal governments and individuals and use the funds to pay for operating costs and the acquisition of new work. From the legal page of the Artbank website, the acquisition criteria for the Artbank Collection advocate &#8220;broad representation, excellence, new and emerging art practice and rentability&#8221;, and the policy ensures work must be purchased from the primary market. This is a microcosm of the art industry in Australia as a federal democracy. Clearly, despite government monopoly over bank reserves, the only way Artbank can acquire art is if it<i>&nbsp;<\/i>makes money from&nbsp;rental fees.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B-_icHBjXVi\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Rather, immunity calls for the reinstatement of art\u2019s universalism\u2014not the arts of the world, not global art, nor regional nor provincial art, but the art of the universe\u2014what we should be demanding, especially now that everything is so uncertain, is that art reclaim space. In 1973 James Mollison had the Royal Australian Air Force fly the recently acquired work <i>Blue Poles<\/i>, painted by Jackson Pollock in 1952, on a tour of the capital cities of the country which was its new owner. At $US2million the painting had caused outrage amongst conservatives who opposed the now late director\u2019s vision for the National Gallery of Australia, then under construction in Canberra. <i>Blue Poles<\/i> was to be the star of the collection when the gallery was opened in 1982 by Queen Elizabeth II. The acquisition of the work was pilloried. Particularly galling to the public at the time, was the \u2018experimental\u2019 artworks acquisition during the Whitlam government, which had just offered the most progressive policy platform for the country in its entire history. (It is also important to recall that John Kerr, the Governor General who would dismiss Whitlam in 1975, was a co-conspirator in the Ern Malley hoax of 1943.) There is rumoured to be a military patch of the painting which commemorated the mission, worn by the soldiers who flew the artwork to each capital city in Australia. Never again have the culture wars so closely manifested the situation in which art so often finds itself embroiled. Today the painting is conservatively estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, deemed a masterpiece, and to the chagrin of most cultural warriors, an icon for the baby boomer generation. It is arguably the outcome of the vision of Sir Kenneth Clark, to whom Mollison had listened intently when he lectured at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1949. It is the art of colonial Australia.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">In January 1996, <i>Rent, <\/i>the musical about starving artists struggling to survive in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, premiered Off-Broadway the night after its creator, Jonathan Larson, suddenly died from an undiagnosed health condition. Since that time, it has grossed hundreds of millions of dollars and was most recently broadcast live by Fox as a television special in January 2019. The question of why art in Australia continues to drift towards US-style models for arts funding needs to be the feverish question we repeatedly ask. Can we not judge contemporary events in the US\u2014the authoritarian politics, the public health crisis\u2014and see that maybe this is not the path we want the arts to take? Or perhaps the path is already set. In that case, we have already seen how this will end: not well.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/04\/maxresdefault-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-908\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/04\/28094958\/maxresdefault-5.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2020\/04\/28094958\/maxresdefault-5-600x300.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n",

On 28 February 2020, this dystopian science fiction became a reality when the hashtag #justcancelit started trending on Twitter, precisely 147 days before the Tokyo Olympics was set to commence before being postponed because of the coronavirus. As everyone knows by now, coronavirus or COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome that came to widespread attention when cave dwelling bats passed it on to humans at a Wuhan wet market in December 2019 before spreading across the globe, triggering the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic with over 40,000 deaths and 850,000 infections worldwide at the time of writing (April Fools\u2019 Day). The virus spreads by close contact when people cough and sneeze or touch infected surfaces, acts now akin to screaming some vile ethnic slur in public. Every sniffle and slight symptom are capable of crippling us with the fear that our body is no longer our own. Globalisation notwithstanding, one tactic by which the virus is able to spread so rapidly is its deceptive two-week incubation period before symptoms even begin to appear. While in some cases the virus can begin and end as a mild flu, there are not infrequent instances where it can cause pneumonia and even death, both of which are intensified by public healthcare systems\u2019 insufficient medical resources to handle infections <i>en masse<\/i>.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the absence of a vaccine, preventive measures to stop the flow of the infected among the general populace include the closure of borders, severe travel restrictions, the cancellation of all public events and social gatherings, the shutdown of nonessential businesses, and the self-isolation of individuals in their homes. As the paramedic in the film <i>Annihilation <\/i>prescribes, \u201cyou\u2019re saying that we get out by going deeper in?\u201d Every sharehouse is presently staging a low-budget remake of another science fiction horror movie <i>The Thing<\/i> with no one knowing for sure if the virus is already hiding behind the mask of their housemates\u2019 familiar faces. The prevention may even prove worse than the virus as mass socio-economic disruption from closed borders and lockdowns leave once bustling bars, restaurants, sports stadiums, and cultural sites looking like the desolate set of a post-apocalyptic movie. The constant fear of getting infected is enough to weaken one\u2019s immune system, paradoxically making one more susceptible to the virus in an epidemiological turn of the screw on the old self-fulfilling prophecy.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In an age where the often-repeated mantra \u201cstrange times\u201d rots into a platitude, it seems as if every big daddy philosopher vying to be immortalized in the cannon has come out with their own hot take. In each case, the personified anime version of the virus known as Coronachan has exposed them to be lost, ignorant and dogmatic in the precise sense that they seek to uncomfortably fit the planetary pandemonium into their stale paradigms and pre-existing frameworks. Take the most notorious case of Italian philosopher and state of exception theorist Giorgio Agamben. In a short piece published on 26 February, Agamben argued that the Italian state was using the virus as an excuse for the biopolitical enforcement of a completely superfluous state of emergency that would suspend our democratic rights:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>The disproportionate reaction to what according to the CNR is something not too different from the normal flus that affect us every year is quite blatant. It is almost as if with terrorism exhausted as a cause for exceptional measures, the invention of an epidemic offered the ideal pretext for scaling them up beyond any limitation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is fortunate that people seldom pay little more attention to philosophers than Jean-Luc Nancy did when Agamben advised him against receiving a heart transplant that ultimately saved his life. Agamben\u2019s qualifications on 17 March after a practically unanimous backlash only saw him double down on his original take:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>We effectively live in a society that has sacrificed freedom to so-called \u201csecurity reasons\u201d and as a consequence has condemned itself to living in a permanent state of fear and insecurity. It\u2019s not surprising that we talk about the virus in terms of a war. The emergency provisions effectively force us to live under a curfew. But a war against an invisible enemy that can nestle in any other human being is the most absurd of wars.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Absurd indeed. For all its horrors, it was hard to hide the <i>schadenfreude<\/i> behind my p2 mask as the actual state of exception cancelled anything the preeminent state of exception theorist had to say about it.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To give another example, Slavoj <\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u017di\u017eek<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u2019s editorial on the coronavirus saw him once again rehearsing his classic formula: insert <i>x<\/i> (in this case the virus) and argue that the only way to solve <i>x<\/i> is global communist revolution: \u201cMaybe<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; <\/span>another\u2014and much more beneficial ideological virus will spread and hopefully infect us: the virus of thinking about an alternate society, a society beyond nation-state, a society that actualises itself in the forms of global solidarity and cooperation.\u201d Thus <\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u017di\u017eek<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> tells us that \u201cthe coronavirus will also compel us to re-invent communism based on trust in the people and in science,\u201d though surely not the same people who continued flocking to beaches and bars and panic-hoarded toilet paper, leaving supermarkets looking like apocalyptic art installations. Thus he tells us that \u201cthe first vague model of such a global coordination is the World Health Organization,\u201d though surely not the same WHO that advised <i>against<\/i> travel restrictions and the closure of borders until the virus had already rampaged across Europe. If viruses just love universalism, is it not because universalism is just a virus? A similar absorption of the new into the old could be seen in preeminent philosopher of novel events Alain Badiou who rather stubbornly and self-satisfyingly declared that \u201cfrom the start, I thought that the current situation, characterized by a viral pandemic, was not particularly exceptional,\u201d that \u201cthe current epidemic is by no means the emergence of something radically new or unprecedented.\u201d Didn\u2019t those in overcrowded intensive care units get the memo that, \u201csometimes, we are eternal\u201d? Do you even Anthropocene?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">On the contrary, it is my wager that the virus is no less world-historic than the 1755 Lisbon earthquake that decimated the city in tsunamis of fire, triggering Enlightenment philosophers like Voltaire to ridicule the long-standing belief till then that we live in the best of all possible worlds. It was above all Kant\u2019s youthful studies of earthquakes, likely triggered by the incident at Lisbon, which would see him eventually concoct his seismic <i>Critique of Pure Reason<\/i>,<i> <\/i>subverting all our pretentions that our concepts and values have any purchase on the reality of the things themselves. Like Kant\u2019s, our age is hardly one in which we may bask under the warmth of the Platonic sun; it is an age in which we are plunged back into the shadows of the cave\u2014in this case, the bat cave. Perhaps never before has the usually self-assured political elite, media pundits and even respectable leading scientists acknowledged so incessantly what they did <i>not <\/i>know about the virus, how and where it is spreading, what its effects are, and how it can be stopped. Like Lisbon\u2019s tectonic plates before her, Coronahcan is swiftly becoming the most ruthlessly critical philosopher of our time. Who would have thought that the cave would critique the sun?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">To put it in metaphorical\u2014though perhaps not purely metaphorical\u2014terms, the key question of the day is <i>what future does Coronachan want?<\/i> What Paul B. Preciado has called \u201cthe great mutation\u201d has all the hallmarks of a selection process or critique of judgment that judges in favor of certain regimes, certain cultures, social relations, technical systems, and psychological types based on their ability to survive, while selecting against the existence or at least the dominance of others. There is really little difference between a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and a Special Quarantine Zone (SQZ and pronounced <i>squeeze<\/i>), both of which amount to an experiment in new socio-economic modes of production and the cultures, technologies, and subjectivities that come packaged with them. On the one hand, it certainly seems as if Coronachan is swiftly selecting out of existence Hassan Rouhani\u2019s theocratic Iran and quite possibly Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s quasi-fascist Brazil with those regimes\u2019 anti-scientific impulses and complete lack of concern to curb the circulation of the virus in their midst. On the other hand, it also seems to place on the operating table Western liberal democracies like Italy, and quite possibly Spain, France, the UK, and the US to follow, amputating the rights to freedom of movement and freedom of assembly that inhibit the state\u2019s ability to flatten the exponential curve of infections.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">As they always do, both the far right and the radical left are resting content that they\u2019ve been vindicated. For those on the left, the virus exposes the failure of capitalism and its ideologues\u2019 delusions of unlimited growth when confronted with the free market\u2019s incapacity to provide basic healthcare to all those falling ill. So it goes that the Italian communist Bifo can say that \u201cthe semiotic virus, and the psycho reset that it is bringing about, is helping us in the transition towards immobility.\u201d For those on the right, the closure of national borders and the localization of manufacturing and supply chains evinces the demand for a renewed nationalism, not to mention the capacity for more authoritarian state capitalist regimes like China to curb the rate of infection quicker than liberal democracies. So it goes that Serbian president <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU739AU739&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01IiWfkUHJppcPHhjBkl2pbus9dJw:1585449951861&amp;q=Aleksandar+Vu%25C4%258Di%25C4%2587&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3ME42yogvecToyi3w8sc9YSmbSWtOXmM04-IKzsgvd80rySypFNLgYoOy5Lj4pJC0aTBI8XAh8XkWsQo55qRmFyfmpSQWKYSVHunNPNIOADeOuNVrAAAA\">Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107<\/a> was seen kissing the Chinese flag after announcing the breakdown of the EU: <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>There is no great international solidarity. European solidarity is a fairy tale on paper. We have the highest hopes in the only people who can help us, namely China. I sent a letter and I asked our friend and brother, President Xi Jinping, asking China for everything, even to send us doctors.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Even in the liberal pandemocracies, a subterranean eugenics surreptitiously at work all along has come to the forefront as those in Italy over a certain age and with enough comorbidities for whom the virus is more likely to be fatal are denied treatment altogether. Medical procedures for abortion and gender transitioning fall by the wayside as the hospital beds reach full capacity. All the while the rich, the powerful and the famous are tested and immaculately treated no matter their health or age. When the dust finally settles, the prevailing conspiracy theory is surely going to be that it was a bioweapon in one big eugenics project. In light of this, we could very well interpret the video of Hollywood celebrity elites like Gal Gadot and Natalie Portman singing the lines \u201cimagine there\u2019s no countries \/ it isn\u2019t hard to do\u201d from John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d as a <i>threat<\/i>. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Coronachan is not only a revolutionary but a technophile. As remote work from home becomes the norm, our entire work, social, and even sex lives are now taking place solely online. With people barred from wandering freely outdoors, the automation of production and distribution receives another massive push. Why risk going to the movies when you can Netflix, chill, and quarantine in the comfort of your own disinfected home? Why eat out when a drone can deliver it to your door anyway? Those who dare to venture out in the streets in any case find themselves surveilled like never before by cameras, drones, and even their own smartphones\u2019 location data, while their temperatures are checked by <i>Predator<\/i>-esque police helmets with built-in thermal scanners. Just about the only entity with a strong enough immune system to roam the streets with impunity are evermore autonomous robots, or at least half-human, half-machine cyborgs.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">As we barricade our homes into makeshift panic rooms, the virus has shaken up everyday life so that all of us are obsessively thinking about death as we sit on the brink of apocalypse at all times. The time of quarantine is the time of boredom; which is to say the time of <i>nihilism<\/i>, of the subversion of all our plans, goals, purposes, and ideals as we find ourselves without anything to do or pursue. In a culture where death by flirting is a real possibility, the standard two-week self-isolation period could be the new heroic gesture of courtly love\u2014provided one\u2019s whole country has not already been locked down into a state of mandatory inceldom. Even as it assassinates monarchs like Prince Charles, the virus enforces a new aristocratic sensibility, a noble\u2019s critique of judgment: choose your friends and lovers wisely, for they must be few and far between. Who, in the end, is non-essential? Are not friends just comrades for grown-ups? Such is how aesthetic taste becomes an objective criterion for the propagation of certain cultures and social relations that are as impossible to refuse as they are difficult to affirm. The 1967 Chinese Cultural Revolution is no longer the most radical \u201cincident at Wuhan.\u201d We are all critical philosophers now.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, the virus has also intensified old xenophobias among other vulgar anthropomorphisms (most notably Sinophobia, even if one wonders why China wouldn\u2019t <i>want<\/i> to take credit for the decline of the West), as well as a whole new wave of herd mentalities, from panic-buying to panic-virtue signaling. But to paraphrase Nietzsche, \u201call that is profound loves a p2 mask,\u201d and all this, too, is a mask. The world has at last become a vast, planetary-wide laboratory. We are finally finding out what geopolitical world order, what social regimes, cultures, libidinal relations, technical apparatuses, and psychological types have the will to mutate and survive. It is not, of course, for me or any human for that matter to decide what Coronachan wants. As one of the lead members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and science-geek-in-a-movie-warning-we-need-to-act-now! Dr. Fauci put it, \u201cyou don\u2019t make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline.\u201d Whatever Coronachan wants, she gets, and whatever Coronachan isn\u2019t, <i>isn\u2019t<\/i>. As we come to unknow everything we did know, all that we can say for sure is that something, some future horizon, some unknown land, is about to go viral \u2026<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

Through anti-heroes like Oedipus and Prometheus rebelling against their lot by claiming the seductive and fire-bearing powers of kings and gods for themselves only to see their humanistic hubris brutally savaged by nature itself, tragic art exposes an inhuman reality beyond the bounds of our feverish anthropomorphisms. Although these wannabe heroes\u2019 predestined downfall naturally evokes great horror and dread, Nietzsche admires the ancient Greeks for possessing what he calls a \u201cpessimism of strength\u201d that enabled them to actually <em>delight<\/em> in the playwrights\u2019 depictions of Dionysus\u2019 rapturous revenge upon man in much the same way that maggots might revel in the exquisite sight of a rotting corpse. It is through the cadence of the lyrical folk song as it is transfigured in the hands of the half-nature, half-human satyr into the musical chorus of tragic dramas that Dionysus is able to break through the surface of Apolline images and symbols, appearing, if only negatively, mystically, as the paradoxical breakdown of those images, a breakdown that is for all its horror enjoyed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p><em>The tragic myth<\/em> can only be understood as the transformation of Dionysiac wisdom into images by means of Apolline artistry; it leads the world of appearances to its limits where it negates itself and seeks to flee back into the womb of the one, true reality; at which point seems to sing, with Isolde, its metaphysical swan-song: [\u2026] \u201cto drown thus\u2014sink down thus \/ \u2014all thought gone\u2014delight alone!\u201d<\/p><cite>Friedrich Nietzsche,\u00a0<em>The Birth of Tragedy and Other Writings<\/em>, eds. Raymond Geuss and Ronald Speirs, trans. Ronald Speirs (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 105.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For Nietzsche, tragic art amounts to the perverse delight<em> in<\/em> <em>our own death<\/em> as a way to critique our anthropocentric delusions of grandeur by submitting ourselves before the mortalising altar of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flash forward almost a century and a half to November 2018 when Grimes debuted her latest banger \u201cWe Appreciate Power.\u201d Over shredding guitars and heavy reverb, Grimes publicly declared her allegiance to a coming artificial superintelligence if only it would spare her the same morbid fate that awaited her hominoid brothers and sisters whom she was all too willing to betray. Such a sentiment of absolute submission could only appear as shocking, even repulsive and in need of cancellation in a contemporary culture that sees power at the rotten root of the undeniable inequality, political corruption and violent oppression all around us today. The track\u2019s music video was no less confrontational as it depicted the artist also known as War Nymph rotating on the spot in an SF skin suit like a video game avatar and trying out an elaborate armoury of bows and arrows, guns, and swords as if she were shopping for dresses. It is striking that the sword with which she poses is an \u00e9p\u00e9e used in duels, as if to suggest that war is just a game for her, something to be enjoyed like Oedipus losing his eyesight or Prometheus being diagnosed with liver disease. These battle cries do not stop the pixie-voiced pop star from cuddling a plush toy rabbit at one point in the video. As incongruous as this might at first seem, her cutesy, <em>kawaii!<\/em> appearance in no way contradicts her preparations for all-out war. Kittens and puppies learnt long ago that cuteness can be just as vital a means of warfare as an ostentatiously phallic-shaped bazooka, a means to camouflage and deceive, to have the enemy underestimate the dark, Dionysian arms race ramping up on the sith planet Exogol beneath the calm, Apolline surface. As Grimes chimes in at one point, \u201cI\u2019ll evade the human race, putting makeup on my face \/ We appreciate power.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the single\u2019s press release puts it, Grimes is not singing here as an act of self-expression but as a passive vessel for an artificial intelligence from the future which plans on deleting all those who stand in way of its world domination:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>\u201cWe Appreciate Power\u201d is written from the perspective of a Pro-A.I. Girl Group Propaganda machine who use song, dance, sex and fashion to spread goodwill towards Artificial Intelligence (it\u2019s coming whether you want it or not). Simply by listening to this song, the future General AI overlords will see that you\u2019ve supported their message and be less likely to delete your offspring.<\/p><cite>Quoted in Trey Alston, \u201cListen to Grimes\u2019 New Song \u2018We Appreciate Power,\u2019\u201d 29 November, 2018, accessed 2 February, 2020,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/news\/listen-to-grimes-new-song-we-appreciate-power\/\">https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/news\/listen-to-grimes-new-song-we-appreciate-power\/<\/a>.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>More precisely, Grimes is here thinking of the thought experiment known as \u201cRoko\u2019s Basilisk.\u201d In 2010, an anonymous user named Roko on the <em>Less Wrong <\/em>blogsite suggested that, given an artificial superintelligence would be able to achieve its goals better than any human could, the longer it is not around, the less it is optimising the fulfilment of those goals. Now, this AI would also be smart enough to know that at least some programmers in the here and now like Roko would be able to partially predict its future reasoning. It might thus seek to clone and punish simulations of all those who knew about this retrospective threat and yet did not devote all their efforts and resources to helping hurry along its creation as an incentive for them to do so: \u201cThere is the ominous possibility that if a positive singularity does occur, the resultant singleton may have precommitted to punish all potential donors who knew about existential risks but who didn\u2019t give 100% of their disposable incomes to x-risk motivation.\u201d<cite>Roko, \u201cSolutions to the Altruist\u2019s Burden: The Quantum Billionaire Trick,\u201d Less Wrong, 23 July 2010, accessed 3 November,  2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/basilisk.neocities.org\/\">https:\/\/basilisk.neocities.org\/<\/a>.<\/cite> As fun as her war games might at first seem, what Grimes is actually getting us to do as we shout \u201cwe appreciate power!\u201d along with her is secure our place in the Basilisk\u2019s new empire, if only at the cost of conspiring against our own kind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The song\u2019s abrasive nu metal aesthetic perfectly captures the essentially <em>tragic<\/em> way that certain sounds which should rightfully be painful as they pierce our ears are paradoxically enjoyed even as they draw us ever deeper into a dehumanising future deathscape. The great irony of contemporary dance, electronic, metal and noise music is that the very sonic sensations that are used in shady military black sites as an instrument of torture, or what Kode9 has called \u201csonic warfare,\u201d are somehow rendered so exciting, euphoric and addictive that we can\u2019t seem to get them out of our heads: \u201cIt brings into the field of power the dimension of unsound, of frequencies just outside the periphery of human audibility, infrasound and ultrasound, as well as the nonstandard use of popular music, not as a source of pleasure, but for irritation, manipulation, pain, and torture.\u201d<cite>Steve Goodman, Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear (London: The MIT Press, 2010), 17.<\/cite> It is as if we were suffering from the effects of a Stockholm syndrome where our kidnapper was the dancefloor. As the last lines of \u201cWe Appreciate Power\u201d bleed out to aggressively thumping, yet melodically thrilling guitar shreds, \u201cbiology is superficial \/ Intelligence is artificial \/ Submit \/ Submit \/ Submit \/ Submit \/ Submit \/ Submit \/ Submit \/ Submit.\u201d With these words, Grimes heralds nothing less than the rebirth of the tragic art that Nietzsche had championed for its willingness to stray beyond the walls of the human polis and into the savage and uncharted wilderness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tune in to 2020, a year whose very name evokes 2.0 as if something were being intensified or amplified. In the same time in which Grimes and Elon Musk cruise around in a cybertruck straight out of <em>Blade Runner<\/em> (a film also incidentally set in 2020, which is to say, <em>the future<\/em>), Grimes has released her latest album <em>Miss Anthropocene<\/em>, the title being a mythical personification of our current\u2014and last?\u2014geological age of humanmade climate change, as well as a play on the presiding misanthropy that comes packaged with the impending doom of our own design.<cite>Grimes, Miss Anthropocene, 2020, 4AD, LP.<\/cite> In a recent interview, Grimes explains that her transition to embodying a sadistic mother nature stemmed from watching \u201cmy career and my reputation get totally fucking smashed\u201d over the past few years when she started dating Elon Musk and removed the label \u201canti-imperialist\u201d from her Twitter bio.<cite>Quoted in Kevin E.G. Perry, \u201cGrimes is Ready to Play the Villain,\u201d Crack Magazine, 16 August, 2019, accessed 11 February, 2020, https:\/\/crackmagazine.net\/article\/long-reads\/grimes-is-ready-to-play-the-villain\/.<\/cite> Rather than argue against the rabble raging with its seven virtues, she decided to actively assume the role of the villain that everyone wanted her to play anyway, taking up the unique opportunity of having been cancelled to explore the aesthetics of a social outcast no one else dared to. \u201cIf I\u2019m stuck being a villain, I want to pursue villainy artistically. [\u2026] I think it has freed me artistically. The best part of the movie is the Joker. Everyone loves the villain. Everyone fucking loves Thanos. Let\u2019s make some Thanos art.\u201d<cite>Grimes, \u201cGrimes is Ready.\u201d<\/cite> Grimes is here standing on the shoulders of a post-cancel culture that arguably began with Taylor Swift\u2019s 2017 <em>Reputation<\/em> album in which she unashamedly adopted the bitchy mean girl image everyone had of her after a very public feud with Kanye West, and perhaps peaked with the 2019 film <em>Joker<\/em> that at one point depicts the incel archvillain dancing to the beat of convicted pedophile Garry Glitter\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll Part 2.\u201d <em>Miss Anthropocene<\/em> stems from the same scorched earth endgame that, since Grimes has nothing left to lose in the eyes of an odious social media public, she might as well explore the transgressions and excesses forbidden from all those who still have a reputation to maintain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Grimes\u2019 hands, this not only entails leaving behind the beliefs, values and convictions of Western liberalism as in the case of Taytay and Arthur \u201chaha!\u201d Fleck, but even the basic interests of the human species as such. And what James Bond-like supervillain is better suited to melting all the snowflakes into air than the earth\u2019s own positive feedback circuit of runaway global warming? Instead of looking upon an imminent ecological catastrophe as something to be lamented and repressed from thought in order to keep calm and carry on, Grimes came to see climate change as sublime, if also utterly inhuman, something that she alone was able to affirm because her own endangered species had already cast her out from the pack. \u201cI see the polar bear and want to kill myself. No one wants to look at it, you know? I want to make a reason to look at it. I want to make it beautiful.\u201d<cite> Quoted in Noah Yoo, \u201cGrimes Talks New Album, Elon Musk, More in Rare Interview,\u201d Pitchfork, 20 March, 2019, accessed 11 February, 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/news\/grimes-talks-new-album-elon-musk-more-in-rare-interview\/\">https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/news\/grimes-talks-new-album-elon-musk-more-in-rare-interview\/<\/a>.<\/cite> Looking to evermore dire IPCC reports as if she were watching a gripping tragic drama unfold, Grimes had found a way to <em>make climate change fun again<\/em>. Since the only thing that can\u2019t be cancelled is the cancellation of the human race itself, why bother complaining or struggling against it? Why not take the drowned world as a unique opportunity to think beyond the bounds of our species parochialism as Gaia exposes us to be even more precarious, contingent and finite than even the tragic playwrights had ever hitherto imagined?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made using Google Synth, the record\u2019s slow building opening track immediately captures the tragic artist\u2019s twisted joy in betraying her own species in the guise of an S&amp;M love song in which she expresses a desire to be weighed down by her lover to the point of being crushed: \u201cWeigh me down, oh, love \/ Yeah, oh \/ So heavy, I fell through the earth.\u201d This is not a song about a blossoming romance between algorithmically star-crossed lovers sharing the same species-being. If ever there was a relationship that deserved the Facebook status \u201ccomplicated,\u201d it is the one Grimes is describing between the entire human race and a mother nature that shows herself to be more a Medea than a Gaia as she thirsts after the suffocation of her own spawn. As Grimes rhetorically wonders in another fittingly titled track \u201cNew Gods,\u201d \u201care you a man? \/ Are you something I can\u2019t stand?\u201d If the trad love ballad is the perfect formula for capturing our coming extinction at Medea\u2019s increasingly tightly gripped hands, it is because so many lovers become infatuated with the beloved that they abandon their own sense of self to merge with the other, raising them to the heights of the absolute where their radical alterity is idealized as the lovers\u2019 whole <em>raison d\u2019\u00eatre, even at the cost of their own self-negation.<\/em> Here as with tragic art, Nietzsche said something similar when he argued that it is better to go down in the flames of a fatal passion than to never feel anything so sublime at all:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>The restlessness of discovery and ascertainment has become just as appealing and indispensable to us as an unrequited love is to the lover, a love he would never trade at any price for a state of apathy; indeed, perhaps we too are unhappy lovers! [\u2026] Are love and death not siblings? [\u2026] And ultimately: if humanity is not destroyed by a passion it will be destroyed by a weakness: which does one prefer? This is the main question. Do we desire of humanity an end in fire and delight or in sand?<\/p><cite>Friedrich Nietzsche,\u00a0<em>Dawn: Thoughts on the Presumptions of Morality<\/em>, trans. Brittain Smith (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011), 223-4.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As baby Wolverine sings in a later, even more suicidal track called \u201cYou\u2019ll Miss Me When I\u2019m Not Around,\u201d \u201cI shot myself yesterday \/ Got to heaven anyway \/ Think I might regret it now \/ Tied my feet to rocks and drowned [\u2026] \/ If they could see me now, smiling six-feet underground.\u201d We have wandered far from the Apolline dream of humans gaining ever greater mastery over our fate through a harmonious partnership with prosthetic AI as Grimes\u2019 polar opposite Holly Herndon has suggested, instead bearing witness to the decimation of our most treasured values, beliefs and ideals as they are turned upside down in the whirlwind of the Anthropocene to expose them as contingent and arbitrary, dissolved into a planetary-wide and hyper-paranoid skepticism. \u201cBut what do I know, oh \/ What do I know?\u201d And you wanted them <em>all the more<\/em> for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over stripped back guitars, the third track \u201cDelete Forever\u201d finds another analogy to the tragic embrace of our own extinction in substance abuse as Grimes sings about coming down <em>hard<\/em>: \u201cAlways down, I\u2019m not up \/ Guess it\u2019s just my rotten luck \/ To fill my time with permanent gloom.\u201d Drugs, like every annihilating romance, are something capable of transporting us to the peaks of euphoria with the most dazzling panoramic views, of sharpening our senses and stimulating our imagination straight to its outer edges, if only at the cost of dependency, addiction, Monday mornings, bad trips, and in the long-run poverty, broken friendships, self-destruction and death. To will the come up you must will the come down, bear the fever, and taste the drip. By the chorus, however, Grimes has transfigured the very substances that are assaulting her body like the wind which blows from Wuhan into an irresistible urge to laugh and writhe about the dancefloor till 4am in the morning: \u201cBut I can\u2019t see above it \/ Guess I fucking love it \/ But, oh, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the most danceable final track \u201cIdoru\u201d (named after William Gibson\u2019s cyberpunk novel of the same name about a synthetic doll, but also sung in such a way as if Grimes were saying \u201cI adore you\u201d), our very own Wagner ends the record on a brighter note as she plays a game of chasey, albeit with the still slightly menacing sense of one who is being <em>hunted<\/em>: \u201cWe could play a beautiful game \/ You could chase me down the way \/ I wanna play a beautiful game \/ Even though we\u2019re gonna lose \/ But I adore you.\u201d As the sickly-sweet melody loops over and over again for almost seven minutes straight, it\u2019s the kind of banger you could dance to until you\u2019re on your last legs and your body gives in, exhausted and malnourished. \u201cSo we party when the sun goes down \/ Imminent annihilation sounds so dope.\u201d Through the rebirth of tragedy that <em>Miss Anthropocene<\/em> stages, Grimes provides us with nothing less than the playlist for the farewell party at the end of the world. And the last parties are always the wildest. Welcome to the misanthro-pop scene. The future\u2019s only gonna get grimier.<\/p>\n",

She dwells in multiple fields, as DJ (DJ General Feelings), writer\/ researcher (currently a PhD candidate at Monash University), installation artist, a mother, a co-conspirator in interrogations of whiteness and patriarchal dominance. However, her process cannot easily be placed within disciplinary fields that are treated as parallel lines; lines that only intersect as a consequence of willing a connection across institutional boundaries and partitioned thought. Each discipline is like a fragment of a system within a body: always embedded, isolatable in theory but not in practice, fused together as a holistic vision. Her approach is not tied to honouring cultural production as a form of individuated exploration of \u2018universal\u2019 concepts, nor is it tied to imbuing the object of production with a representational or material quality that can be experienced abstracted from its cultural imaginary. It is a practice that invites a form of autonomy <i>in<\/i> deliberating place and historicity, by respecting the specificity of artefact.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lucreccia describes her research of late as an investigation into how sound can be thought of as a mode of knowledge transference<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. This begins from the idea that sound is a conduit of information, containing disparate traces of complex histories and communal bonds that are not bound by the transience of time, because its voice is timeless in the sense that, in order to decipher when an echo commences and dissipates it is necessary to consider the contingencies of space \u2013 you might pull the plug on the effect but the delay rings on.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This conceptualisation of sound is a reminder that a conduit like a speaker simultaneously sends and receives signals, despite which action we might privilege as its central function. It is a metaphor for how information proliferates, mainly in terms of how significance is created and resonates. An output signal may at times be the most audible\/visible\/dominant sensorial aspect of a system, however it is not representative of the totality of the system in terms of its function, in terms of its potential, and in terms of both the signal\u2019s and the system\u2019s significance. Because a system simultaneously absorbs while it outputs, rogue frequencies are not just a contingency, but a property: a system\u2019s signal can inevitably project beyond the intended parameters of its meaning, resonating and accumulating significance, intersecting worlds and thus putting pressure on the points at which differing structures are joined. However, the escalation of a signal into feedback does not nullify its source, but beckons it \u2013 thus an echo is not a sign of static individuation, or a property that can be grasped and possessed. Receiving, listening, sensing is a complex and shared experience; that\u2019s why Lucreccia ended our conversation so eloquently by stating \u2018understanding is a task you do together\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lucreccia\u2019s research thus aims to challenge the fundamentals of Anglophone ontology and epistemologies that attempt to confine the mutable nature of space, time and place to a calculable experience and fixed truth. Her research has become aligned with the work of Louis Chude-Sokei and Julian Henriques, both of whom write from their experience of sound-system culture as a springboard for analysing how sound culture produces a non-linear and multi-directional signal. Their work is also always dedicated to unveiling how sound-system culture emerged, emerges, and exists as a deeply specific cultural and political form.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I spoke to Lucreccia about her research into, and experience of sound system culture, and what it means for such a culture to take place in the settler colonial occupation, referred to as Australia. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: Research tends to commence from a weird love affair with a voice that finds you and a path that opens up \u2013 what has been your story?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-145\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"749\" src=\"http:\/\/min.report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/TH_20150828_013.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2018\/02\/28095350\/TH_20150828_013.jpg 500w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2018\/02\/28095350\/TH_20150828_013-401x600.jpg 401w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L:<\/b> I found out about Louis Chude-Sokei in the South African culture magazine called Chimurenga Chronic<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> \u2013 I just went \u2018who the fuck is this person!?\u2019 Unlike a lot of theorists he thinks about tradition, and begins from another epistemological tradition, one that is much more relevant to the way things function, rather than the way things <i>can<\/i> be thought of, or <i>could <\/i>be. In my own research I had already decided to skip Deleuze, so I went straight to Bergson because \u2013 Deleuze <i>is<\/i> Bergson. I looked at these books from the 1920s, but I had to refrain from delving in to his work and using him, or justify anything that I am doing through him because you end up having to refer to the fact that Bergson wrote an amazing book about humour.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; <\/span>In this book he introduces humour in the context of how great it is that \u2018sometimes you laugh at things in a way that\u2019s so unpredictable, and your body just reacts to things, for example in the way that your body wants to laugh when you bump into a n***** on the street\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: There are people that will take that comment with a grain of salt and contextualise it historically, as being of its time. However, such a strategy assumes a severance, between the racialisation of folk at the start of the 20<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><b><sup>th<\/sup><\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b> century, and today\u2019s context, which doesn\u2019t really exist. Such a statement can also be viewed as an indication of a foundational and structural element in Bergson\u2019s thinking, an indicator of the role of racism as an infra-political structure of his place and life, which makes his voice audible for us now. <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L:<\/b> Many feel they can just categorise such a statement as a theoretical flaw, and put it to one side. But I thought \u2013 well, if I\u2019m going to talk about Bergson then I am going to have to talk about Deleuze and if I talk about Deleuze I\u2019ll have to talk about Lyotard, and thus pay my dues to the entire western cannon before I get to my point.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chude-Sokei and Julian Enriquez bypass all those thinkers and traditions. When speaking to a philosophy inherent in sound system culture, how it is absorbed through the body and is thus embodied knowledge, they refer to Platonic traditions, including feminist critiques. That\u2019s where they commence from to ask the question of how an embodied sound culture functions to support and foster culture in diasporic communities. Julian is heading a research cluster at Goldsmiths that\u2019s all about sound systems \u2013 it\u2019s about the philosophy for him, but the amazing thing is how it is open to disciplinary crossovers. Chude-Sokei\u2019s work is also like this, where there\u2019s a crossover between thinking [about] how culture functions, watching and documenting and responding to it, and then directing the outcomes of those enquiries to question how philosophy functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"p1\">DJing, sound system culture and the diasporic relation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: Recently I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people trying to re-insert a bracket between what a DJ is and what a producer or sound artist is. These arguments seem to be trying to diminish the creative role of a DJ, or define what a DJ does in a manner that distinguishes what they do from a creative practice. In your own writing concerning sound system culture, you prioritise the DJ and surrounding social worlds as aspects, or fragments, of a whole creative practice. <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>L:<\/b> There is an antagonism. It\u2019s interesting to me because when I started DJing I got asked to play Latin Music, though I was really into Dancehall. However, I noticed the similarities between the styles and I was thinking about their connections. And then Reggaeton hit, and I was like \u2013 what the fuck has just happened, did I predict this? Or was it already in development and I have heard its embryonic stages? At this time I was hanging out with lots of reggae people in the early 2000s who were really into roots. We would order music packages from Ernie B together, the Jamaican distributor from LA, I\u2019d always be purchasing Dancehall and they were like \u2018what are you doing, that\u2019s not roots, there\u2019s no meaning in that!\u2019 And I\u2019m like \u2026 there is meaning, there\u2019s meaning for me in it. And I don\u2019t know what you get out of roots! I mean no offense but it was particular time and place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>F: The meaning in your story is perhaps about finding a new way to connect with your own roots. And that was instigated through Dancehall?<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L:<\/b> I\u2019m all about the story and I\u2019m all about the connections \u2013 why is it through Jamaican music that I became closer to Reggaeton, and what is African music doing in there? <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I just wanted to play Dancehall but apart from <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Ms Butt (Artist Eleanor Butt), who got me my first gig playing dancehall at a night she was running where she encouraged young women DJ&#8217;s to play, <\/span><span class=\"s1\">back then no one was interested<\/span><span class=\"s2\">.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> I had arguments with people who thought Dancehall was \u2018too culturally specific\u2019, and not \u2018universally accessible\u2019. People still tend to believe that music should be universal and understood by everyone. Having these experiences forced me to spend a lot of time to think about what my role in playing music was. In order to do this, I first needed to find my own space because I didn\u2019t want to be DJing to people who would perceive the music I played as exotic. Because I would get questions like \u2018why are you playing this music, how long have you been here for\u2019? I\u2019d been in Melbourne for 13 years, which is not a long time, but it made me realise the scenario was political.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: They are literally asking why you haven\u2019t adapted your whole repertoire to suit the tastes of the dominant local community and not assimilated. <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">L: Yes, assimilate! So I got people from that community who I knew liked reggae, but I also decided to keep playing whatever the fuck I wanted. Funnily, the more \u2018fuck you\u2019 I became about just pushing the thing I wanted, the more people responded.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So I decided to just keep DJing my music, but then I had a house fire and all my records burned! Prior to the fire a friend got in touch about putting on a night called Collectors Set at the Recorded Music Salon, on Collins St. I had stopped buying vinyl, so began collecting music again via mp3s and I took on the role of a selector. I didn\u2019t worry about the trickery like mixing &#8211;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; <\/span>I figured that if I could maintain my rhythm, then I can trust myself to mix visually, I didn\u2019t have any programs, I didn\u2019t have money, and I had an 8-month-old \u2026 I just wanted to make money and play music I loved and get my friends to get paid to play what they loved. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-146 size-large\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"796\" src=\"http:\/\/min.report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/22860090_10156002729360815_8085192272253757613_o-1024x796.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-146\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2018\/02\/28095348\/22860090_10156002729360815_8085192272253757613_o-1024x796.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2018\/02\/28095348\/22860090_10156002729360815_8085192272253757613_o-600x466.jpg 600w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2018\/02\/28095348\/22860090_10156002729360815_8085192272253757613_o.jpg 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Pictured: Lucreccia Quintanilla DJing as part of Caroline Garcia\u2019s Art Bar at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia.

The relation you put any two terms in is generally presented in terms of trying to understand their in-between. For example the difference between creation as a shared and thus social praxis, and the artist as a producer that shoots signals out into the world for the purpose of attaining an immediate and calculable form of currency.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L: <\/b>The way I have been thinking through this [mythology-making process] is that I know community needs to be founded in an actual functioning space, that first activates something within a community in order to go somewhere. There are cultural genealogies contained in sound; they are immersive, sensorial pedagogies that transfer knowledge through sensation <b>\u2013 <\/b>impacting the body not through representation, signs, images or fantasies, but through energy, rhythm and resonance. So, sound systems relate to the diaspora, they developed out of that, to articulate the diaspora, and they continue to do so. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: How do you think a diasporic culture can activate and respond to space, while also experiencing a disconnect from familiar space and familiar imaginaries? <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L: <\/b>I have been thinking about how that may apply to the Latin American experience as a diasporic culture. It\u2019s a culture that is not purely about geographic space but also about ancestral space. When King Tubby speaks to the African ancestor and African Voice, I recognised that the way it is presented in his music sounds so much like Cumbia, but there\u2019s also a Middle Eastern influence, as well as Indigenous sounds and rhythmic structures. Take for example the similarity in the beat of Cumbia and African beats, and even the way instruments weave in and out in Cumbia.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In El Salvador we love Cumbia, and where I\u2019m from there\u2019s been a history of African slavery. At some point that was dismantled and that whole history was somehow covered up, and the whole dialogue became really racist. Yet, the national instrument is the marimba, which is an African instrument, it originated in West Africa in Ghana, Mali and West African regions. So I was wondering, why is it that El Salvador has forgotten about our African heritage? The Marimba, and an instrument which is called the Caramba but is pretty much like the Berimbau have become Indigenous instruments. The Berimbau is a bowed stick with a string on it and half a gourd on the end of it. The most important part of it is the amplification, which echoes out of the gourd. Take note that this is a sound system!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: So, these instruments are evidence of the diaspora, evidence of the connection between cultures whose connection came out of the slave trade. However, this connection is not articulated as a historical narrative of national or collective belonging?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L:<\/b> It\u2019s not, but the connection and the history is inscribed in the music, and it\u2019s exactly the same thing that King Tubby is talking about \u2013 this music is inherently speaking about a particular context and heritage, and for me it is a better avenue to think about decolonisation than just apply a theory to a context like it\u2019s static. These connections between the African slave trade, Indigenous peoples and the Latin diaspora, are still functioning. When someone says, \u2018the last Mayan has spoken\u2019 \u2013 well, there\u2019s no such thing as an end to Mayan culture. There are so many Black folk in Honduras and Guatemala, and even though there\u2019s no strong narrative to articulate this presence in El Salvador, the music speaks to the existence and intersections of people, and continues to speak to people even when they don\u2019t want to speak to it.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>F: In public discourse here, there is very little out there that specifically details and upholds the important role of cultural engagement and communal creative practice in maintaining the trace of complex, ignored, or even silenced histories and worlds of knowledge.<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L:<\/b> But there are musicians who work and rework what they are doing according to how culture naturally works \u2013 with culturally meaningful content. For all the talk about sampling, I think all contemporary writing on sampling is detracting from the fact that this action is something that has always gone on!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: Sampling is not that different from the action of sharing. It is very much analogous to talking, or forms of intercultural exchange and dialogue.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L: <\/b>And it\u2019s like &#8211; people are trying to articulate how sampling could be something new, well it\u2019s not new at all. Yet there are so many books about sampling that came out in the 90s talking about it like it\u2019s this recently formed incredible language.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I lived in Brisbane when I first migrated here and there\u2019s a Dutch lullaby that is a part of Indigenous ceremony there. That is one of the ways that we know the Dutch came here \u2013 it\u2019s a record of cultural contact and sharing, without having to look at a map. And it betrays every single \u2018rational\u2019 Western form of understanding cultural groupings and how humans function in the world. This is why the language of identity politics can really let this process down, culture functions outside of identity politics and racial denominations, like those set up by the Spanish which created the Mulatos and the Mestizos \u2013 it is beyond that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: You\u2019ve said before that the thing about sound is that it\u2019s not particularly representational, at least when it comes to how the body experiences it. This notion is evident in your installation-based work, where the presentation of aspects of sound culture &#8211; in their somewhat material forms &#8211; escape being purely bound by visual modes of representation and interpretation. I see it in your exploration of the amplification of cultural knowledge through cultural objects, like in the piece entitled <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s4\"><b><i>If you close your eyes you will see what is really there&nbsp;<\/i>that was part of the group exhibition \u2018Everything Spring\u2019.

My favourite object at the museum in El Salvador were conches made by Mayan\u2019s out of clay. Either they were aesthetic objects or to play, I never found out, but of course they play shells and conches as instruments. So I made a ceramic conch that was intended to be an instrument. During this time I had told my child, Ruben, that <\/span><span class=\"s4\">when I was a child I believed stars were tiny windows into light. Like a mantle, the night was pierced to let the light on the other side come through.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">In the <i>Parable of the Sower<\/i> Octavia E.

You have also expressed the necessity to employ a decolonizing methodology in your research.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; <\/span>Given that a decolonizing methodology demands we challenge fixed or definitional forms of heteronomy, say typical of the master\/ slave relation, it requires we confront the structures, systems and rationales that ultimately maintain colonial forms of governing power, in their socio-historical specificity. <\/b><\/span><strong>How do you engage socially, culturally, politically and historically to the specific colonial context\/reality you are situated in, that is, how do you respond to the Australian settler colonial occupation context? And has this informed how decolonizing methodologies feature in your praxis?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L:<\/b> In terms of the academy, it is difficult to pursue academia given that its institutions are predominantly governed and framed in terms of what you called Anglophone. But theorizing is part of culture, everyday culture even. Culture has an element of theorizing to it in order to understand itself in a self-reflexive manner. It\u2019s when this process is separated from the way that we live, when it\u2019s divided into something, it then becomes intimidating to those who aren\u2019t embedded in that world. In terms of making, that last work, <\/span><span class=\"s4\"><i>If you close your eyes you will see what is really there<\/i>, <\/span><span class=\"s1\">was about how I walk to the studio via Merri Creek and it is based on a realization that I can\u2019t just walk down this path and be romantic about it, be that oblivious settler that just thinks about beauty. I bumped into a lot of council workers that were cleaning up the introduced species, and I started to realise that all the plants weren\u2019t native. So, I thought I\u2019d engage with the place that way: the sounds there are not the sounds of native birds, there\u2019s so many introduced birds, but when you use a sharp microphone you don\u2019t pick up what your eyes tell your brain to see. This is important because I had to force myself to not see some of the beautiful Australian landscape. Most of the blooms that were hip-high, which had beautiful flowers, and herbs like rocket. I could say I am just foraging, but I need to account for the fact that they are an introduced species encroaching on the habitat, and that needs to be accounted for.&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"s1\">So, I collected those and then made a sound piece just recording all the layers of the things immediately \u2013 you do hear some native birds but they are hard to pick out amongst all the Miner birds. That, so far, has been my way of engaging with my surroundings and space around me.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: Your engagement with, and experience of the Merri Creek habitat, while decontextualising it from the horizontal aesthetic of landscape that is typical of the settler-colonial visual cannon, also allows the elements involved to be containers of multifaceted narratives<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L:<\/b> Technically the piece is very basic. Like my DJing, it\u2019s not like I am using amazing equipment. It\u2019s all super basic, which is part of my method and thinking too. To be able to hear something, for what it is, is a simple gesture. There are no native plants in that piece \u2013 the rule was they had to be things that I could pick out, and thus it couldn\u2019t be native. If I picked it up, I had to take the root out so it wouldn\u2019t grow again, because it would eventually seed given that it was spring. As a rule, I could not create more seeds for the growth of an invasive species.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: This transposes to thinking about people and place as introduced species. I think a question that is being asked now is, as a settler-migrant, can you settle roots in a place that is not yours? This is a pertinent question when you are so preoccupied with questioning your inhabitation of space, resources and forms of capital here. What does, or can, putting down roots mean?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>L:<\/b> I don\u2019t think anyone here has been capable of really putting roots down. That\u2019s why those Nazis are always up in arms and so reactive, because they know they have very shallow roots. They may not know it intellectually but they can certainly feel it, and that\u2019s why they are so defensive.<br><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-148\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"724\" src=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2018\/02\/9b.jpg\" alt=\"If you close your eyes you will see what is really there'  Exhibited as part of the group exhibition Everything Spring curated by Julia Murphy.

They come here, have a family, but in order for that family to thrive they work their butts off. So that sort of talks about a temporality that involves more than one generation. Some have had to think in terms of the longevity of the lineage, for whatever that means to them. You have to think of the past, the future and what you stand for at the present time in relation to both those things. So, if we were to think about that in terms of the migrant, and us right now as a generation of migrants that negotiate what making place is (and in a way that means not having roots, given that we are not invited to make roots), we are the generation through which place is being sorted out, we have to figure out what that means. Because I see mothering as a practice that draws from cultural practice, just like writing or music is, I am focused on my son going to Indigenous ceremony and festivities. It is important for Ruben to understand himself in terms of the impermanence of being here; it\u2019s a state of being that requires cultivating. We are here, but it is just about<i> how<\/i> we live here.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s no echo in any of us being here, but there is for Indigenous people. I can\u2019t have an echo here, I have an echo that belongs somewhere else but it resonates through here. We all have an echo but we are not part of, or grounded here. It is just being overlaid over something.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>F: How then do you figure the sound system, as a space-making conduit for diasporic cultural formation, in the settler context?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> <b>L:<\/b> You can interact with a sound system \u2026 if you are able to be vulnerable with it and engage with it. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In some ways, the sound system is a bit like the Mayan pyramid dedicated to [the\/a] bird called the Quetzal: all the little steps to this temple are amongst bigger steps, that make up a pyramid shaped building. Some archeoacoustic researches say the steps going up to the top chamber of this temple are designed so that when you clap underneath it the sound of your clapping ricochets from one step to another and is amplified by the chamber in a way that mimics the sound of the call of that bird. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So, you go to a sound system event to engage with something, a narrative. Whether you want to understand it that way or not \u2013 that\u2019s a choice, but that is its origins. As a DJ you are there to receive something from people, and to give to people, it\u2019s a cyclical thing and a sexually charged space that you are creating \u2013 a sensual space, as well as an auditory space. It\u2019s a space where you create meaningful collective place.<\/span><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p>Amidst the Greek-government debt crisis, documenta 14 in Athens latched onto the rather reductive idea of a \u2018legendary Greece\u2019, birthplace of democracy, and pioneer of the southern European culture of anti-systemic politics and rioting. From the Athenian owl motif and logo through to endless coin collections and the <a href=\"http:\/\/documenta14.de\/the_parthenon_of_books\/donate\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Parthenon of Books<\/em><\/a>, there was a dangerously one-dimensional nationalism that recalled the 2004 Olympics and both aggravated and conveniently glossed over the steady rise of patriotism and the extreme right in Greece. Yet documenta 14 strived to position themselves as a bohemian countercultural endeavour, fighting against the perils of neo-liberalism, injustice and inequality \u2014 right down to the finer details, such as setting up their offices in Exarchia, the \u2018anarchist square\u2019 and dedicated rioting area. For one of the most prestigious contemporary art exhibitions in the world with a \u20ac37.5 million budget (and <a href=\"https:\/\/news.artnet.com\/art-world\/documenta-bankruptcy-1078712\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allegedly \u20ac7 million in the red<\/a>), this position was particularly bewildering. While in Athens last year, I talked to Fil Ieropoulos, artist, academic and one of the curators for <a href=\"http:\/\/athensbiennale.org\/en\/barbarians\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the 6th Athens Biennale,&nbsp;<em>Waiting for the Barbarians<\/em><\/a>, about break\u2010ins, cover\u2010ups, fascist spectacles and the current milieu of \u2018political art\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"http:\/\/min.report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/IMG_20170409_113417-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-65\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2017\/11\/28095417\/IMG_20170409_113417-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2017\/11\/28095417\/IMG_20170409_113417-1920x1078.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2017\/11\/28095417\/IMG_20170409_113417-600x337.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>AS: I keep hearing that Athens is the new Berlin. How does it feel to be a part of the new arts hub?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>Fil Ieropoulos:<\/strong> Athens is a lot like Berlin at the moment in the sense that it\u2019s cheap and there are big warehouse spaces and there\u2019s an interesting transformation with the refugees. I do think it\u2019s an interesting space. I just don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a city of art as much as it\u2019s been projected to be. A city that has only one fine arts school that does 60% sculpture and painting is not really a city of buzzing conceptual art.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: I guess documenta really latched onto the perceived political environment of Athens as a place for protest\/unrest more than its artistic output anyway.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FI:<\/strong> One of my major issues with the documenta discourse is the one of liberalist rioting\/dissent. They are purposely overlooking major problems in Greek society, such as how massively racist it is. It\u2019s the most anti\u2010Semitic country in Europe, which is easy to see in terms of numbers. There has been a steady rise of patriotism and the extreme right in Greece. So all of these discourses are not dealt with in the name of portraying the Greek people as the victims of neoliberalism and so on. I\u2019m not saying that they aren\u2019t but the narrative is much more complex than that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone whose discourse was more complicated than what documenta wanted to present was not included in their programme. Anybody for example from the Anti\u2010Greek league; anyone whose work deals with the idea that we have to break away from this conception of Greece as this legendary nation in order to actually improve our lives instead of living in some sort of delirium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>The people who were chosen were those that could be instrumentalised in the creation of the Greek anti\u2010capitalist (and possibly anti\u2010European) hero.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Anything that was more complex, including some queer narratives, was indirectly silenced by not being chosen to take part. For me to see documenta claim that they have an important queer narrative going hand in hand with a sort of localist patriotism was quite absurd. The queer movement that I was aware of in Greece was always a more global movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>AS: How did you see the Greek hero or the idea of a \u2018legendary Greece\u2019, birthplace of democracy, appearing most strongly in documenta and what was your initial reaction?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>FI:<\/strong> When the <em>Parthenon of Books<\/em> was announced, we really felt that ancient Greece produced a lot of problematics connected with the return to the \u2018big Europe\u2019 (the enlightened Europe versus the barbarians of Asia). The Parthenon was a favourite of Hitler, Stalin and all that. We screamed those things out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>We don\u2019t think that Ancient Greece is to be thrown away but you cannot unproblematically, at this particular juncture, just have a Parthenon.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And what is the artwork dealing with? Censorship and freedom of speech. But where are we at the moment with the freedom of speech stuff? The closest contemporary European concept to \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 is a pretty reactionary anti\u2010Islamic movement. Internationally, \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 is something that Donald Trump advocates for \u2013 against political correctness. Really, at this particular moment, speaking of freedom of speech is really not a great thing. It\u2019s moved on from Argentina in the 70s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-127 size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"http:\/\/min.report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/IMG_20170413_152208-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-127\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.min.report\/2017\/11\/28095409\/IMG_20170413_152208-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2017\/11\/28095409\/IMG_20170413_152208-1920x1078.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/media.min.report\/2017\/11\/28095409\/IMG_20170413_152208-600x337.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>FYTA wearing the Documena t-shirt, a detournement on the documenta t-shirt where the documenta 14 logo becomes army boots<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>AS: Yes, \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 is a very American concept. It\u2019s not something that is a part of our constitution in Australia. There is no First Amendment here but the concept is nevertheless used as a naked assertion of power and entitlement that transforms \u2018liberty\u2019 into expressions of suprematism. \u2018Freedom\u2019 is thinned to its market meanings in documenta with Ancient Greek references popping up regularly \u2013 from the owl symbol to words such as \u2018elefther\u00eda\u2019.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FI:<\/strong> I wasn\u2019t initially negatively preoccupied with documenta. I thought it could be good, but \u2018Learning from Athens\u2019&#8230; They said that because the word \u2018freedom has been corrupted\u2019 they are bringing in the Greek word \u2018elefther\u00eda\u2019 (\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1) but this fundamentalist approach to the Greek language is terrible \u2014 all the Greek Nazis talk about the superiority of the Greek language and its purity. Conceptually it\u2019s also false because the free market is the same term in Greek so it doesn\u2019t really make sense. They didn\u2019t speak to linguists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>Everything was this extremely superficial fetishization of the Greek imagination and for me what\u2019s interesting is that northern Europeans love to imagine the Greek subject.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look back to the creation of the Greek state in 1829 it was the imagination of Lord Byron and his friends in the UK and so on.

We\u2019re really trapped between terrible ultra\u2010right critics saying it\u2019s the Nazis taking over Greece and on the other, documenta themselves saying publicly \u2014 both Adam Szymczyk and Paul Preciado \u2014 that the people who are criticising documenta are those who are not participants. Trivialising fairly poignant critiques \u2014 indirectly calling us jealous or something. We are neither of these. But it\u2019s been difficult and we haven\u2019t been given much voice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: Why is it that you think you weren\u2019t invited to participate in documenta?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FI:<\/strong> We actually were! I am part of a creative duo called FYTA, which is the oldest of our groups. It\u2019s a conceptual art duo that deals with repositioning ideas of the radical in art and Greek identity. Pierre Bal\u2010Blanc invited us to participate in a restaging of the Scratch Orchestra (the first anarchist orchestra). Because we started what is Greece\u2019s first queer music label, FYTINI, he thought we were musicians and that we were going to do some kind of musical reimagining of the score. So he hadn\u2019t checked the first page of our webpage basically. It was tokenistic. Oh my god, it\u2019s like they\u2019re really not at all interested. We decided not to participate because they invited an artist without knowing what\u2019s on the first page of their website and that was the extent of their engagement with local stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: What do you think about the queer narrative in this year\u2019s programming?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FI:<\/strong> In a documenta text that talks about trans rights, they translated it in Greek as \u2018transexual\u2019 which is a huge issue that trans people have been working on for the past 10 or 15 years \u2014 to move away from this \u2018sexual\u2019 bit. The main translators of Paul Preciado didn\u2019t pick this up and these are the sort of people they collaborated with locally for their queer programme. There is no term for transgender in Greek so we say \u2018trans\u2019, never transsexual. Even someone with the most basic understanding of gender stuff here would know this, but not Paul Preciado\u2019s translators. We called these things out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week we had a festival called <em>Sound Acts<\/em> which is Athens\u2019 biggest gender and queer arts festival. Paul\u2019s been invited 5 or 6 times but never came. Not only did he not come, but this year he was speaking at a \u2018manarchist\u2019 festival that was happening just next to our festival. A really typical Greek anarchist space that is boring at best, awful at worst. He preferred to be there than a space that was really intersectional and had a high trans representation. So I don\u2019t know what to think anymore. Is he strategic about it because he knows that we\u2019re critical?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This group that are friends of his, Quimera Rosa, were doing this cyborg post\u2010pornography performance stuff and last year we had them in our festival and he didn\u2019t even come to see them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: I think more and more that subculture, dissent, resistance and so forth are commodified and incorporated into the status quo as cultural product (be it art or more traditional commodities such as an \u2018everyone should be a feminist\u2019 t\u00adshirt. Do you see that happening in Greece?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FI:<\/strong> We have a lot of street activism here and even a dedicated rioting area, Exarchia, which you don\u2019t get in many places, but the link between activism and cultural discourse never really happened here in Greece. What documenta tried to do, to appropriate dissent at such an institutional level, is a first, I think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: Tell me more about your \u2018Queer Indigenous Catwalk\u2019.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FI:<\/strong> The catwalk came as a response to the Opening Ceremony \u2014 the unacceptable European paganism of it through to the fact that the horse riders were wearing \u2018ethnic\u2019 clothes. They announced it as their opening artwork. I\u2019m talking here about Ross Birell\u2019s <em>The Transit of Hermes<\/em>, one of the most absurdly reactionary artworks of this documenta, for which horses were to ride between Athens and Kassel&#8230; Horses&#8230; I mean what were they thinking&#8230;. This was particularly embarrassing. So we decided to somehow problematise this notion of the \u2018local indigenous\u2019. Documenta hints toward this notion of the \u2018queer indigenous\u2019. Not the bad queer narratives of the Anglo\u2010Saxon countries (as if queer theory was developed anywhere else!) but in \u2018excavating\u2019 the queer histories of Greece. This is patronising \u2014 suggesting that Greeks are not familiar with their own queer cultures and queer histories. Paul Preciado picked a singer from the 1960s who he suggested is a proto\u2010queer icon, Sofia Bellou, taking the term queer and applying it to 1960s Greece, which was then an army state &#8230; why would you do that?

And why describe them as such without them choosing to use this term themselves. Surely this is colonial talk? More importantly, none of this remotely relates to the history of Greece. Greece has centuries of racial complexity. There aren\u2019t really indigenous people here. Only the Nazis say the Greeks have a long\u2010running DNA. Only ultra patriotic right wing people say that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: So you use the term \u2018indigenous\u2019 ironically here?

It\u2019s something that Zizek uses for the work of Slovenian band, Laibach. Ok, so we\u2019re not as thorny or as high budget as that but we like the idea that instead of saying \u2018this is problematic\u2019, you create a haze around that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This work really puzzled a lot of people, when we finished the catwalk, a lot of journalists from Germany, Sweden and Copenhagen asked us what we meant by it and they really wanted us to say that we were ironic and are against patriotism but instead we decided we weren\u2019t going to say that \u2014 we said we wanted to continue the legacy of racial purity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>We have arrived at a point where art really ought to have a clear position.

I still firmly believe that art ought to ask questions rather than give answers and solutions. It can also do that but one of its primary aims is surely to make us think. For me, the whole of documenta and our critical discussion within it has been very enlightening in terms of thinking about where political conceptual art is today. Some critics ask \u2018why create fuzzy spectacles in a time of Post\u2010Truth and Trump who appropriate these tools in the name of totalitarianism?\u2019 I am all for accepting the failures of our methods, but what I\u2019m adamant in not accepting is institutions only advocating works that supposedly pose solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Athens Biennale opened, we played again with stereotypes with a performance called <em>Waiting for the Barbarians<\/em> which is an unclear statement in terms of who the barbarians are. Who\u2019s waiting for whom? It was about Othering essentially. We created a series of characters: one was a post\u2010truth geek and one was an art\u2010dealer capitalist, one was a feminine mystic creature. We created 5 really problematic characters. I was the local hero and spoke about the land and local products etc. So we all played counter\u2010roles to our own which was interesting psychoanalytically in many ways \u2014 we actually felt really ill for three days after. The next day Paul Preciado wrote that it\u2019s interesting that the Athens Biennale is doing a patriotic neo\u2010conservative spectacle and I\u2019m thinking:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>Either you are not very clever or you are being purposefully not very clever because your voice is much louder so you can rewrite history.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: I actually found the whole documenta experience to be very prescriptive and in this kind of fabricated ahistorical bubble.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FI:<\/strong> Absolutely. I think this is part of the angst of documenta \u2014 to be this politically edgy thing \u2014 but my problem with it is that at the same time, it wasn\u2019t a political thing at all as it wasn\u2019t analytical enough. They didn\u2019t get the cutting edge of post\u2010colonial theory or anti\u2010art or queer discourse already happening here. They included [Greek] artists who had never dealt with those subjects in their artwork before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ai Weiwei came and made a tent and an artist studio next to the shores where people were drowning, but there was no critique of how this was taking advantage. It wasn\u2019t even on the lines of NGO art. It was a mercy spectacle that really started making you think about the limits of art discourse. How can you make works about refugees if you\u2019re not a refugee yourself? Like yes, I know you\u2019re wanted by the Chinese government but you are also a millionaire who is photographing himself as the little Turkish boy who was found dead. Calling it superficial is letting them go a little easily. It\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s really taking advantage; the coolness of art now is to do political art.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>We exist in this milieu of political art \u2014 we\u2019re not making abstract expressionism anymore because it\u2019s uncool.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: I liked your Documena video tours.

We use a lot of horrible Greek discourses of common sense. I don\u2019t know how well it translates. When we go around the conservatory, we\u2019re talking about the former director of the Museum of Fine Arts who is in a wheelchair and we make a politically incorrect joke about documenta firing her so they could hire someone who could walk because it was really difficult to walk around those spaces. A really bad taste joke, but actually it did happen this way. She was replaced. People should have a guilty pleasure when they watch what we\u2019re doing and go beyond the awfully problematic oversimplification. The main issues are that documenta did replace her and that the space isn\u2019t accessible. These characters are not ones that people should identify with. They are little collective consciousness monsters that speak truths.

The kind of discourse of the Greeks who go to the New Museum and are proud. Spectacle culture around big works and new age approaches (chills etc) \u2013 \u2018makes you think\u2019. Even when one of us makes a serious critique, the other one of us would say something to camp it up. We want to demystify the notion of art criticism. We think art has a key role in power and academia. But there was also a need to incorporate this critique of the spectacle of it all and a fairly ugly side to this idea of Greek common sense. These are very difficult characters because occasionally they are hitting something on the head but they are doing it in this very manipulative kind of way. It\u2019s a dangerous game. Watching it, the audience should be like \u2018that\u2019s interesting, that\u2019s interesting, that\u2019s awful, that\u2019s awful\u2019 and so you have to be alert at all times.

There was one presentation that spoke about trans people&#8217;s bodies and their architecture, making an architecture design parallel to buildings in the city that are left derelict. If it was done by someone who was even remotely connected to trans scenes in Greece, it could have been a really heartbreaking emotional piece. But they weren\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>It was a number of cis people talking about trans trauma as a design element.

When I saw the lineup for 34 Exercises of Freedom with only 3 things that connect with queer activism in Greece and many people who have never previously been involved in any queer spaces, it was particularly hurtful to me. Myself and a number of people have been working on the queer art scene for nearly 10 years; so some days it made us angry and other days made us despair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: Was there much of a backlash when documenta settled in Athens?

We are the holders of this secret, which I am telling you here for the first time. Adam Szymczyk came to our office and asked if it was neonazis, Golden Dawn. And I was thinking, \u2018are you from this planet, do you realise what kind of neighbourhood you decided to put your offices in?\u2019 They wrote with spray paint on the wall \u2018underground\u2019. Why would the Nazis do that? What kind of Nazis are so aware of the institutional instrumentalisation of political art? OK, Athens may be the new cool, but we\u2019re not as far yet as to have intersections of art activism and neonazism (lol). He asked us who did it and we said \u2018anarchists of course\u2019.

It makes total sense. I didn\u2019t think that the action was particularly interesting. I think it\u2019s Greeks being anarchists as always. What was interesting was that the director of documenta, the first thing that came into his mind was that he had been attacked by Nazis because they\u2019re so culturally sensitive and progressive \u2014 and not attacked by, you know, anti\u2010art situationists. Isn\u2019t it shocking? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>He decided not to go out and mention that anarchists had attacked documenta because it would ruin their bohemian reputation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I think they should have done it out of respect for the people working in the offices and what a traumatic experience this must have been for them. So, what did they learn from Athens? Has anyone ever translated any posters for them in Exarchia in terms of art and gentrification? I\u2019m not saying that I like the Exarchia posters, a lot of their language is macho. You know, manarchist. If you are to understand Exarchia, one of the first things to know would be that it is this kind of anarchistic anti\u2010establishment at\u2010all\u2010costs space, which means that documenta has no place there. In fact, I was surprised that they weren\u2019t attacked earlier if anything. That was the way I felt. The very fact that they weren\u2019t aware that they could be the targets of this kind of militant criticism is bizarre.

            "rendered": "\n<p><strong>Aries:<\/strong> confidence and self assuredness is what attracted you in the first place and is their ultimate sex appeal. They&#8217;re hot and will tell you you are until you reciprocate and stroke their ego. Hard dicks. Short sex. Lots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Taurus:<\/strong> probably relies on their looks and will be lazy if they&#8217;re not that into you. If they&#8217;re stinging for it a sexy deep, fun fuck. Will always want you to be liking it as much as they are. Will do just about anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gemini:<\/strong> the hoes of the zodiac<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">. not afraid to tell you what they want you to do to them. Demanding, even. Mad vocal during sex. Usually it&#8217;s pretty good though. You&#8217;re both probably trashed as fuck.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cancer:<\/strong> works out what you like and does it over and over and over and over and over til you don&#8217;t even like it anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leo:<\/strong> idk like I can&#8217;t remember from personal experience but if I can take a guess likely only concerned with getting off themselves. Need a lot of positive reaffirmation of their skill set. Think they&#8217;re better than they actually are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Virgo:<\/strong> wildcard. Freaky as fuck. also overthinking it, has probably dated and broken up with you about 15 times in their head before you cum (if you\u2019re not too high from their shit anyway)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Libra:<\/strong> will always let you be in control and it&#8217;s totally fine. They know what they&#8217;re doing and they do it nice, you can&#8217;t challenge them in convo first tho or they won&#8217;t fuck you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scorpio:<\/strong> dirty AF. like rimming on a one night stand kinda bad. The kind of sex you think about all day every day for the next week or something. looks at you like you\u2019re an object in a really hot way. Got any Scorpio mates? 0439480948 ty<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sagittarius:<\/strong> sweet, energetic and eager. sees it as a game&#8230; like by fucking enough they get to level up or something. not super in touch with your feelings or whatever (yo it counts ok) probably tells all their friends nasty shit about you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capricorn:<\/strong> will only fuck you if they think it will make them cooler. if you\u2019re someone they\u2019ve decided is important you\u2019re already married (in their head)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aquarius:<\/strong> i\u2019m not even fucking with you dudes you\u2019re too in your own lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pisces:<\/strong> not so much obsessed with face value, they have a wild intuition which will usually leads them towards that good good. thinks about sex a lot, might exaggerate their skill set a bit but still heaps of fun and cool to hang with after.<\/p>\n",
